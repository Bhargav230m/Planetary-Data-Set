 “the natural system”—a middle course—neuropterous
      insects—white ants and their ways—kings and queens—a royal
      diet—secondary majesties—soldiers and workers—ant
      invaders—methods of warfare
if there is any plan in this little book it will no doubt appear in
time to its readers but i myself am only quite clear as to this that
not being of a scientific nature it will not include a definition of an
insect why should it everybody knows what he thinks an insect is and
those who may be willing to have their ideas on such a fundamental
subject disturbed will rightly consult some work of greater authority
than this can pretend to so instead of worrying myself and others
about what insects really are or what are not really insects as for
instance spiders centipedes scorpions and the like all which i
propose to include in my tale—should they happen to present themselves—i
shall confine myself to saying something about what some insects do and
i shall let one suggest and lead to the discussion of another quite at
haphazard and without any attempt at system or classification whatever
this in fact is my own idea as to what is “the natural system” and
the only trouble about it is knowing where to begin because as there
are some  known insects[] and any one of them will do as well
to start from as any other there is a great _embarras de richesses_ in
such cases the usual thing to do is to take either the head or the tail
of the series—to commence with the _hymenoptera_ which include the
highest and most intelligent forms such as the ants and bees or else
with the _collembola_ or _thysanura_ which are understood to contain
the lowest i shall not adopt either of these methods the _neuroptera_
as far as i can make out (and if they don’t it doesn’t matter) stand
somewhere about the middle and with them accordingly—as being between
the two extremes—i decide to break ground having done so as i said
before i may go anywhere—absolute freedom will be mine like plato i
can follow the argument whithersoever it leads; inspired with which
reflection i hasten to begin it
though the order of neuropterous—which by the way means
nerve-winged—insects does not contain any ants yet the so-called white
ants or termites—which are very like ants in their ways and almost or
quite as interesting to talk about—are included in it they are
commonest in tropical or at any rate very hot countries such as
africa australia and south america and here the conical or
dome-shaped structures made of red earth which they erect above the
surface of the ground and which contain the greater part of the nest
are of such dimensions as to take a very prominent part in the features
of the landscape often they are covered with vegetation including
bushes or even small trees on which in africa antelopes are
accustomed to browse in australia there is no reason that i can see
why kangaroos should not at least upon the grass which must often
clothe them and which is their staple of food
    these great mounds are made by the white ants and contain
      their nests; but large and strong as they are the ant-eater
      breaks them down and devours the ants a queen white ant is
      shown at the right-hand corner with the extraordinary
      development in which the eggs are carried
these great mounds are pierced in every direction with innumerable
galleries leading to and from the various cells and chambers in which
the domestic economy of the white ants is principally performed one of
which known as the royal cell contains the king and queen and is
situated beneath all the others not all white ants however—for there
are several species—are governed or presided over in this way grassi
who studied them in sicily[] declares that the whole of the termitidæ
whether belonging to southern europe or the still hotter countries from
which they have no doubt been unknowingly imported fall into two
primary types in the first of these the colony is presided over by a
king and queen representing the fully developed male and female forms
which have once unlike the workers and soldiers—for like ants these
insects are divided into castes—possessed fully developed wings which
they have subsequently got rid of in the same way that the queen ant
does hers in the second type the colony possesses several kings and
queens but these though they marry and produce offspring are not
perfect males and females and never possess wings they are in fact
produced artificially by the working termites just as the hive-bees are
able to make themselves a new queen—should they require one—by feeding
an ordinary worker with royal jelly and by a method somewhat similar
though not precisely the same the royal substitutes being fed not on
any extraneous substance but on a salivary fluid secreted by the
workers themselves—saliva in fact the colony however is in this
case not founded by the royalties thus bred up but by a portion of a
pre-existent colony which migrating from the parent nest takes this
method of augmenting its numbers[]
in the termite nest as amongst ants all members work for the good of
all the soldiers which are furnished with large heads and long
scythe-like jaws take upon themselves the duties of attack and defence
though in some species they only do so when the enemy is of a formidable
nature leaving unimportant foes to their less specialised companions
these are equal to such inglorious tasks but when the colony is invaded
by hostile members of their own race or by some fierce ant enemy they
retreat into the inner recesses leaving the danger and honour to
others such an enemy is _cremastogaster scutellaris_—or call him
cremas—who though never invaded by the white ants enters their nest—or
termitary to use the learned word—intent upon massacre under such
circumstances “the soldiers place themselves with gaping mandibles
waiting for any ant that may come within reach they then snap their
jaws rapidly shearing off antennæ and legs tearing the abdomen or
even cutting the ants in two the soldiers’ mandibles are seen to act
like extremely sharp shears”[] this should be somewhat discouraging
for the ants and indeed they seem rather shy of the soldiers
avoiding their heads and “only daring occasionally to attempt to lop
off their mandibles” their more considered method which they adopt
whenever practicable is to approach them from behind and bite their
abdomens the soldiers on their part endeavouring to protect this
vulnerable portion—and it is a fairly large one—of their anatomy by
creeping backwards under pieces of wood or stones from which the head
with its murderous jaws is alone allowed to project
in these encounters the advantage does not seem to lie so decidedly with
the ants as to explain their conduct in making the invasion since
peace according to professor grassi’s observations is usually
concluded “after about an hour’s conflict with a certain number of
killed and wounded on both sides”[] as a result however it would
appear that the ants often remain in possession of a portion of the
nest whilst the original occupants have to be contented with what
remains if this therefore is their object the invaders have carried
the day but if as seems likely under natural conditions they should
prefer to return to their own home they can hardly be said to have done
so information seems wanting on these points
as with ants war is also waged between the various species of
termitidæ _termes lucifuga_ for instance—for where there is no english
name there is nothing for it but to speak latin—is though much smaller
a terrible enemy of _calotermes_ the soldiers of the latter can
indeed without much difficulty cut their own in two but their greater
activity is often more than a match for the superior strength of their
opponents the workers are more easily disposed of but with these the
soldiers of _calotermes_ do not often concern themselves they are left
to the nymphs[] and larvæ the equivalents with the latter species of
a true worker caste which has not yet been developed amongst them as it
has with others of the family when professor grassi placed a worker of
termes in one of his calotermite tube-nests[] it was at once placed
_hors de combat_ by a nymph (somewhat a shrewish one) of the latter
which rushing upon it cut off a portion of its mouth other nymphs as
well as several large larvæ then hurried up and proceeded to further
the good work by severing the unfortunate creature’s legs and tearing
open its abdomen in all this the soldiers took no part until one
towards the end of the struggle advanced and added his single bite to
those which had been so plentifully bestowed similar observations were
made upon various other occasions from which it appears plain that as
before remarked the soldiers of this—very probably of all the
termites—are accustomed purposely to reserve their strength for foemen
worthy of their steel
it will be seen from the above account that termites differ from true
ants in one very important particular namely that they are as active
and free-moving in the larval and pupal states as in the mature or
imago one “the termite society” indeed “consists for the most part
of wingless sexually immature individuals children potentially of both
sexes which do not grow up”[] out of the majority of these the worker
caste when it exists is formed whilst a much lesser number develop
into the large-headed long-jawed soldiers both of these castes
apparently are produced independently of sex that is to say they are
potentially either males or females and not composed exclusively as is
the case with ants and bees of undeveloped females only the genuine
king and queen of the termitary would seem to have attained the true
imago state; such substitute royal forms as the workers by feeding the
larvæ with saliva are able to produce retaining larval
characteristics though sexually mature—a phenomenon scientifically
known as _neoteinia_ as with the bees these potential future royalties
are bred up by the working termites to meet possible future emergencies
they are never allowed to leave the nest and should any accident
befall the reigning king and queen a pair of them are chosen to rule
and produce offspring
                               chapter ii
    ant language—stridulatory organs—how white ants
      communicate—conversation through convulsions—nests
      in tubes—detection of a “crepitus”—mutual
      recognition—cannibalistic propensities—royal jealousy—loyal
      assassins—a kingly feast—methods of feeding—foundation of
      colonies—swarming habits
it used to be supposed that such communication as ants are capable of
holding with one another took place entirely or almost entirely
through the mutual stroking of the antennæ and sir john lubbock (now
lord avebury) was unable to satisfy himself after numerous experiments
that they could either hear or utter any sound it is now known
however that not only can some ants emit various sounds at their
pleasure—as indeed is sufficiently obvious in the case of one or two
species—but also that they possess special structures enabling them to
do so and the existence of which is inconceivable except on the
supposition that they both hear and attach a meaning to the notes thus
evolved thus at a meeting of the entomological society held in the year
 dr david sharp (author of the “insects” portion of _the cambridge
natural history_) declared that “examination revealed the existence in
ants of the most perfect stridulating or sound-producing organs yet
discovered in insects these being situated on the second and third
segments of the abdomen in certain species the sounds produced were of
the greatest delicacy and it appeared doubtful whether the microphone
would be able to assist the human ear in their detection”—which indeed
it has not yet done[] later in the work above mentioned dr sharp
remarks “in many ants these parts”—that is to say the abdominal
segments—“bear highly developed stridulating organs and the delicacy
and perfection of the articulations allow the parts to be moved either
with or without producing stridulation”[]
as these ant utterances are not sufficiently loud to be audible to our
human ears they must i suppose be inferred from the existence of the
organs above-mentioned and the way in which they work; but this is
surely sufficient data to go upon since it is hardly possible for one
hard substance to grate upon another silently forel accordingly as
well as janet and other observers now believe sound to be one of the
principal means by which ants hold converse with each other and it is
interesting to find that grassi and sandias have arrived at the same
conclusion in regard to white ants or termites their opinion together
with the facts upon which it has been founded is thus expressed:—
“several writers have mentioned the convulsive movements characteristic
of termites these movements or quiverings are easily observed in
calotermes and may be repeated periodically at very short intervals
almost at the frequency of the pulse-rate in the act of quivering the
legs are held motionless whilst the body is shaken forwards and
backwards sometimes a white ant may stop whilst running in order to
quiver one or more times occasionally these convulsive movements are
repeated a few times only and then stop altogether; but at other times
they recur after a few seconds’ or at most a few minutes’ rest and
may thus be continued sometimes for hours at regular or irregular
intervals in the intervals between successive convulsions the insect
remains still or progresses for a short distance only these movements
are executed by all members of the colony except the newly hatched ones
i have satisfied myself” continues professor grassi “by careful
observation of the phenomena exhibited in tube-nests that these
convulsions serve as a cry to summon help or give alarm or as a lament:
in short as a mode of intercommunication”[]
the same observers then go on to tell us that if white ants are
disturbed in any sudden way as by the too rough shaking of their nest
or by a light being suddenly flung upon it or if otherwise annoyed
“all the members of the colony begin to quiver except those that are
running briskly about in search of a better situation”[] when dying
too they will sometimes quiver in this way at intervals of a few
minutes for as much as an hour or two or even longer should an
enemy—such as those we have been speaking of—be introduced of a sudden
into the nest the less valiant members of it prefer to run away but in
the midst of their retreat they may often be seen to stop and quiver
with unusual energy their object in these cases seems to be to raise a
general alarm nor is it long before they are successful again if
whilst one insect is burrowing into wood another outside should quiver
in this way the burrower quickly comes out as though in response to
some signal of alarm from all this it seems evident that these curious
movements must be accompanied by some sound or sounds inaudible to our
human ears and perhaps having a varied range and with considerable
power of modulation to produce them however some stridulating or
other organs would seem to be necessary and of these though they must
if there be visible under the microscope professor grassi says
nothing possibly however sounds may be produced by the rubbing
together of various parts of the body without any special apparatus
having been developed in which case the language if we may call it so
cannot be so rich or copious
the above remarks apply more especially to the larger of the two white
ants of southern europe in regard to the smaller one professor grassi
makes the following interesting remarks: “termes makes the same
convulsive movements as does calotermes but the soldier of this species
is able to produce a special creaking sound which arises whenever the
head is held horizontally during the act of quivering by friction
between the back of the head and the front part of the thorax but
whenever the head during this act is held in the usual position which
is not quite horizontal no perceptible sound is produced owing to the
absence of such friction the soldiers of termes therefore possess two
distinct modes of communication whilst those of calotermes have only
one in which no perceptible sound is produced this characteristic
_crepitus_” continues the professor “may be heard at frequent
intervals by applying the ear to a tube containing a nest of termites
this proves that the quivering motions are a constant feature in
undisturbed nests so that they cannot be employed only as signals of
alarm or distress i conclude therefore that besides such special
significations these convulsive movements must also have the value of
ordinary speech; that they constitute in short a means of
intercommunication the same conclusion holds good for calotermes (the
one we have hitherto been talking about) and i imagine that the
quivering of both species produces a sound which is perceptible to the
insects themselves but inaudible to the human ear”[]
members of the same ant community are known to recognise each other and
this is no less the case with the white ants or termites thus when a
few of the latter were removed from the termitary and returned to it
after five or six hours the population showed no signs of alarm—not
scurrying wildly about as they would have done had strangers been
introduced—but remained quiet and orderly it was objected however
though i cannot see the force of such an objection that the exiles on
their return would have instantly recognised their old nest and thus
knowing exactly where to go and what to do they would have created no
disorder and consequently roused no suspicion amongst the other
members of the colony to meet this theory professor grassi provided one
of his colonies with a new nest from which he excluded a certain number
of individuals so that when these were introduced into it an hour or
two after their companions had settled down in their fresh abode it
was of course quite unfamiliar to them in spite of this however
they caused no disturbance but were clearly recognised as friends
when however a few strangers of the same species were introduced they
created great alarm amongst the rightful proprietors who scattered in
all directions in a little while however all was again quiet and as
no fighting was observed it would appear that amongst the termites
strangers from different nests soon become friendly with one another
this however applies to the commoners only it is not the same where
royalty is concerned thus when a second king and queen were introduced
into a termitary already provided with a pair they were at once
attacked by the subjects of the latter who loyally bit off their legs
two days afterwards the reigning queen was herself seen to attack the
male pretender or rather unfortunate victim of scientific curiosity
he however though without legs to assist him managed to drag himself
away but was afterwards found dead with the outraged queen nibbling
vindictively at his mutilated stumps next day the stranger queen was
also found dead and the same thing always happened whenever the
experiment was repeated sometimes indeed the supernumerary royal
pair or pairs had disappeared altogether from which it seems clear
that they must have been not only killed but eaten
cannibalism indeed is rather an institution than a vice in the
termitary to begin with the cast skin of every member is eaten by the
others as a matter of course with this view any individual who is
ready to moult receives the skilled aid of two or more assistants who
either eat the outer portion of their friend bit by bit as they shred
it off or else carry it away whole and devour it at their leisure
sometimes moreover one after licking another affectionately in the
way that ants do may be seen to give it a covert bite as though
desirous of something more filling whilst any sick member is eaten by
its companions before it is dead royalty is not exempt from this
treatment and on one occasion nine individuals including one
soldier were observed by professor grassi in the act of enjoying a meal
on the body of a substitute king who was in process of moulting the
wretched animal was still alive and writhed all over its body to free
itself from the torture the nine assassins were probably annoyed at the
light for they at once stopped eating and jointly carried off the
victim to a darker part of the nest meanwhile many others crowded up to
partake in this feast of royal flesh[]
a soldier too has been observed to kill and partially eat one of its
worker companions nor is it altogether uncommon for an individual of
any class after licking for some little while the leg of another
suddenly to snap it off the bond of union therefore though
sufficiently developed to allow of an elaborate social organisation is
not so strong between members of the same termitary as it is in the case
of ants amongst which latter such unseemly conduct is never known to
occur so too unless a particular chemical substance which seems to
have a maddening effect be flung amongst them ants of one community
never attack each other amongst white ants however warfare will
occasionally break out within the nest more especially if this be
disturbed in which case the soldiers are apt to turn savagely on those
nearest to them perhaps considering them as the cause of the calamity
still upon the whole order and if not friendship at least
co-operation is conspicuously displayed and the majority often
interfere to put a stop to such individual or partial combats as may
from time to time break out
there is more excuse for the soldier termites in their cannibalistic
propensities since owing to the special development of their jaws
which are long and slender they are unable to triturate wood which is
the basis of diet of these insects they might die therefore but for
such occasional lapses were it not the common practice for all members
of the community to feed one another though the soldiers for the above
reason are much more dependent on such aid the food thus administered
has just been swallowed by the individual who parts with it such
transfer is performed in two ways the first of which is familiar
enough—that process namely known as regurgitation—but the second and
more staple one is too peculiar to be dealt with in a non-scientific
work when a termite regurgitates an exceedingly small round pellet of
reddish-brown colour may be seen by attentive observation to form
about the mouth and gradually to increase in size till it becomes
plainly apparent and is seen to consist of food—that is to say
wood—which has previously been swallowed in a moistened and softened
condition sometimes this pellet is used for building purposes but
often another termite comes forward receives and swallows it
another article of diet which has a peculiar efficacy and is used for a
certain purpose has been already alluded to—viz saliva this we are
told “issues” when required to do so “as a colourless and distinctly
alkaline liquid it collects on the labium (the insect equivalent of
lips) as a small drop which may be employed either as a cement in
building or as food for others these may either possess themselves of
the drop and then retreat a little way in order to swallow it gradually
or they may receive it from the one which secretes it and clearly
provides it for them as an article of diet the assimilation of a drop
requires a certain number of acts of deglutition which may be counted
and are usually four or five”[] very young larvæ (the whole community
it must be remembered are either in this or the pupal state) are fed
after this fashion until sufficiently advanced to be able to swallow
wood-meal under this course of diet the abdomen becomes remarkably
transparent and this in older individuals is an indication that they
are being bred up by the workers to become royal substitutes the
development therefore of termites from the larval to the perfect or
at least the sexually perfect form seems to be wholly dependent on
their being fed with this substance
as is well known the body of the queen termite in the african and
other tropical species swells when about to lay to an enormous size
but this is not nearly so noticeably the case with her european
representatives neither is a cell in this case constructed for her
accommodation but the royal pair whether they are true king and queen
or only substitutes “remain in close proximity in the heart of the
nest where the inmates are always most crowded” they are not
imprisoned therefore; but can go from one place to another should
they as sometimes happens wish to change their situation in this they
would seem to be happier than their more specially accommodated royal
cousins but no doubt with the latter or at any rate with the queen
the instinct of locomotion ceases with the capacity to indulge in it
the purpose of the specially made cell is probably rather to guard than
to restrain the queen
in regard to the swarming of white ants—another habit in which we are
reminded both of ants and bees—with the subsequent founding of a new
colony professor grassi has the following remarks to make they apply
more especially to the larger of the two european species viz
calotermes “before swarming” he tells us “they collect near one of
the exit-holes of the termitary and when the proper time comes issue
from it in ones or twos so that the twenty or thirty members who are
ready to take flight emerge in perhaps a quarter of an hour once
outside they run upwards if the locality admits of it for a few
metres and then only do they take wing in a room they fly towards the
light and if a wind is blowing they follow its direction some
becoming tired settle soon upon trunks of trees and all may do this
eventually here they group themselves into pairs the males and females
of which must frequently be derived from separate nests since the sexes
swarm separately; this acts as a safeguard by which calotermes
habitually avoids in and in breeding matrimonial alliances having been
thus formed the work of excavation commences each pair seeking for
some decayed spot in which to bury themselves and become in time the
parents of a fresh community the wings by this time have been got rid
of they may be shed by coming into contact with an obstacle or by
getting damp and adhering to some spot while the insect continues to
move but if not favoured by chance the calotermite purposely rids
itself of these now useless encumbrances thus four perfect insects were
captured after flying about the room and put under a piece of rotten
wood hardly had they settled when they stripped off their wings by
resting the tips against some projecting corner of the wood and then
moving backwards a little so that the wings bent near the base broke
and dropped off when rid of them they began to gnaw the wood at first
along and then across the grain when they encountered each other by
chance they first threatened to bite one another and then ran off in
opposite directions this was because they were of the same sex had
they been of opposite ones an attachment under such circumstances
would no doubt have been formed between them”[]
this is all the space which i can afford to these interesting insects
there are many other points in connection with them which i might have
touched upon but i thought it better to say less about what may be read
by anyone in a score or so of works and select as my text-book a series
of the closest and most interesting observations which lie buried in
the pages of a scientific journal not at all likely to meet the public
eye where possible i shall be guided by the same or a similar
principle throughout this small work
                              chapter iii
    ants and white ants—guest insects—ants’-nest beetles—doubtful
      relations—a strange forbearance—yellow ants and white
      wood-lice—beetles fed by ants
from what has been said about the termites in the last chapter it is
clear that they very much resemble ants in their habits so that it is
no wonder that they have long passed for ants in popular estimation
such a similarity is quite enough to justify one part of the name as
names go; and as for the word white which entomologists are always
complaining about that is quite near enough too for though their
bodies are not white but yellow yet the greater part of them—the soft
fat abdomen which particularly catches the eye—is of such a light
yellow that it suggests white in contrast to the darker colouring of
most ants scientific men—unless their particular science is
philology—are dreadful pedants in regard to names and always want to
substitute their own manufactured ones which have no real life in them
for what has sprung up naturally on the lips of the people thus
instead of hedge-sparrow—a name that explains itself to anyone who has
seen the bird and knows something of its ways—ornithologists would have
us say “hedge-accentor”—a preposterous concoction—and stormy petrel
should according to them be “storm-petrel” because the bird itself
cannot be stormy whatever the sea may be no imagination behind the
common use of language then no poetic transference of attributes all
is to be as prosy as professors can make it and “we must speak by the
card or equivocation will undo us” but names which are a part of
language come into being as language itself does—spontaneously that is
to say and by a natural growth they are right because they exist; and
the very errors contained in them—telling as they do of popular
beliefs and superstitions—are of greater and wider interest than the
rectitudes of a few pedants could they play with substance as they can
with breath these wise simpletons would first draw up a theory of
anatomy and then annul all bodies that did not conform to it such and
such a word or name is wrong in their eyes though it exists quite as
naturally as any nerve or muscle and is quite as tough though only made
of air this last they will find if they live long enough and
“hedge-sparrow” and “stormy petrel” will survive all their lifeless
substitutions though embalmed in many dull paragraphs of many dull
books
but let us come back from words to things much as the white ants
resemble real ones in many of their habits the more remarkable ones
that distinguish the latter are not practised by them they make no
slaves and keep no domestic animals—at least i have never heard of their
doing so though in natural history one must always be prepared for new
discoveries many insects do in fact live with them in the termitary
just as others live in the formicaries of ants and it is quite possible
that when these have been better studied some of them will be found to
have special relations—involving mutual intelligent action—with their
landlords
at present however we seem to have little or no information on this
head with ants it is different and perhaps one of the most interesting
chapters in their history is that which has to do with these
_myrmecophilous_ or guest insects as they are called[] take for
instance the ants’-nest beetles and especially one family—the
_paussidæ_—which numbers some  species every one of which passes the
whole of its life when not flying by night within the nest of some
species of ant these beetles are small as might be expected the
largest being not more than half an inch in length but present an
extraordinary appearance owing to the antennæ ending in two broad
palmated surfaces like the horns of a moose deer which project
outwards one on each side at right angles with two short stalks
forming the only serviceable joints of these strangely modified feelers
all the other ones (in some species at any rate) have been fused and
welded together to form these flattened club-like structures the use of
which is not at first-sight apparent and may not be fully understood
if however a _paussus_ is laid on its back upon a flat surface a
predicament which would be as embarrassing to many beetles as it is to a
turtle one of their special functions is at once seen turning back the
two clubs till they rest on the ground and making the joint rigid the
insect uses the one most conveniently placed as a lever and soon gets
on to its legs again could we imagine that such an expedient would
often need to be resorted to the curious modification of the antennæ is
at once explained; but it probably rarely happens that any small beetle
finds itself on its back in a place where there are no irregularities to
aid it in righting itself possibly however the smooth galleries or
chambers of some of the larger ants might expose these _myrmicophilæ_ to
such a catastrophe though for my part i suppose that the antennæ are
used in some other special way which is of far more importance to their
owners
the relations existing between the ants and these curious beetles has
not yet been fully made out it is true that the various species of
_paussidæ_ have upon some part of their bodies a smooth downy
substance—a _pubescence_ to use the word dear to entomologists—which in
other ants’-nest beetles is known to exude a sweet honey-like dew which
the ants not unnaturally are very fond of and for which they
assiduously lick them as they have also been seen to lick their
_paussi_ we seem here to have at least the root of the matter nor
does the fact that at other times when perhaps these have ceased to
supply the attraction they pay little attention to them seem of much
importance since we are all neglected when we have given what we have
to give but there are other circumstances not of so straightforward a
nature it has been lately discovered by a french observer—m
péringuey—that these _paussidæ_ welcome guests as they generally are
will yet sometimes eat the larvæ of the ants with whom they live when
any small worker is engaged in carrying them from one place to another
the ants resent this and occasionally a large one who feels himself
equal to the undertaking will attack and even kill a _paussus_ that he
sees behaving in such a manner yet with all this so valued are these
beetles by the ants that they often drag them back into their nests
when they have approached or emerge from the entrance on such
occasions and also when the ants attack and even dismember them the
_paussidæ_ make no sort of resistance yet they are extremely well able
to do so being armed with a weapon of tremendous efficiency by which
in a moment they could kill or stun a whole crowd of ants round about
them for they are bombardier beetles having the power at any moment of
discharging a fluid of a highly acrid nature and so volatile that on
coming in contact with the air it explodes with a puff of blue smoke
exhaling at the same time a very pungent and unpleasant odour when they
are tickled with a straw even this bombardment at once takes place
and ants all round are seen to stagger or drop to the earth small
workers are killed large ones retreat in confusion; yet the owner of
this deadly battery which can only have been developed for the express
purpose of overwhelming an enemy will not even to save life or limb
discharge it against an ant—not one at least to whom it stands in
these somewhat doubtful relations
how have these relations—whatever in their entirety they may be—come
about my own idea is that these beetles like some other
creatures—amongst them the little white wood-louse that lives with our
own _formica flava_—found ants’ nests very comfortable places of
retirement since by reason of their peculiar weapon of defence they
could defy any attempt to interfere with them on the part of the ants
the ants on their side would soon have given up molesting them so
that never requiring to defend themselves against the creatures by whom
they were surrounded the intruders got to associate them with quite
other ideas and having first lost the habit at length lost the power
of turning their artillery in this direction meanwhile _paussus_ owing
to its sweet secretion which after relations had once become amicable
the ants would soon have discovered had got to be a very welcome guest
so much so that even when it took to eating their larvæ they retained
their love for it as a species though resenting such conduct upon the
individual and now the once redoubtable invader could be punished with
impunity for the habit of never discharging against an ant had become a
fixed inherited instinct not to be got rid of even though life were at
stake thus as it appears to me it may have come about that though
armed with dynamite and carrying bombs no living _paussus_ has ever
defended itself against an ant and no living ant perhaps ever seen a
_paussus_ discharge its artillery of course these are only conjectures
and the last especially may be opposed to fact since it has been
suggested that one way in which _paussus_ may make itself useful within
the nest of its hosts may be by bombarding certain obnoxious parasites
or other would-be invaders this does not however appear to me to be
likely for how could these explosion take place under such
circumstances without doing damage to the ants themselves in one’s own
house one would hardly wish a bomb to be thrown even against one’s
greatest enemy—at any rate not in the drawing-room that the ants
should by this means be able or if able willing to rid themselves
of the mites which infest them as has been conjectured seems
especially unlikely—indeed hardly possible on the whole it seems to
me that the relations at present existing between the two insects could
only have grown up through _paussus_ having ceased to discharge not
only at an ant but even—owing probably to there never being any
occasion for it—in an ants’ nest the experimental tickling with a straw
was of course an artificial stimulus in spite of its sweet secretion
i cannot see how a beetle with such a power at its command as _paussus_
has can have been originally selected by the ants for domestication
but on the other hand an armed invader might easily by coincidence
possess some property which would make it in time of use and value to
the population on which it forced itself
an example of an invader having no such merit but harmless and that
has become tolerated through necessity is in my opinion the little
white wood-louse before mentioned it apparently has now lost the power
of rolling itself into a ball but when it first began to penetrate into
the galleries of _formica flava_—our little yellow ant—it may very well
have had it and this would have rendered it impervious to attack
whilst its weight and round scaly surface would have made the task of
removing it almost an impossible one thus perforce it stayed where it
wished to stay penetrating perhaps deeper and deeper into the
labyrinth of galleries as successive generations of cave animals have
retreated farther and farther from the light of day until at length
finding the wherewithal to live it became wholly subterranean in its
habits lost the power of doing what it never required to do—namely of
rolling itself into a ball—and through the absence of all sunlight
lost too its colouring matter and became of its present dead
bleached white whether its eyesight if it ever had any is also gone
i do not know; but it can hardly under present conditions have any use
for it whereas its antennæ are constantly moving and seem to be of
extreme delicacy i could never observe—for i have kept nests of
_formica flava_—the smallest sign of any kind of relations between these
wood-lice and their hosts; and if any scavenger work is done by the
former from which the latter derive benefit i believe that this is
merely incidental and that the ants know nothing about it but they
have got accustomed to the wood-lice being there and put up with them
because they cannot help it
it must be remembered in regard to _paussidæ_ that the family is
represented by some two hundred species all of which pass the greater
part of their lives with ants in regard to this mr kirby remarks: “the
observations made upon the family are so contradictory that the
discrepancies can only be accounted for by supposing that different
species have very different habits possibly some species may perform
various useful services to the ants while others are hostile; or they
may be so useful that the ants are willing to pay toll of a certain
number of their offspring in return”[]
this last however does not seem very well to accord with recorded
observations as to ants attacking any individual _paussus_ whom they may
chance to see devouring their larvæ nor with the latter refusing to
bombard under these circumstances even when in danger of their lives
it is impossible to imagine a hostile _paussus_ not bombarding in such
a case unless indeed we suppose it to have first lost its hostility
and then again to have become hostile without however regaining the
power of using its natural weapon but this is a state of affairs hardly
to be conceived
we probably do not know the whole round of occupations which make up the
life by day of the _paussidæ_; of their life by night we know nothing
at all the nefarious raids upon the larvæ or eggs (for both are
appreciated) of the ants can hardly be of frequent occurrence or the
partnership one would think must come to an end other ant-guests
however including sometimes smaller members of their own family are
likewise preyed upon by these curious beetles but very frequently when
observed they seem to be asleep nor do they appear then to be taken
much notice of by the ants where or under what conditions their eggs
are hatched or what is the larval and pupal history of each species we
do not know but only the perfect insect has as yet been found in any
ants’ nest
other beetles that live with ants are either indifferent or hostile to
them but others again are kept and tended in the same manner as are
the aphides and for a similar purpose all or most of these secrete
some sweet substance which their hosts lick up and in return offer
them an asylum from all enemies and are ready to give them their
personal protection should this be necessary they go even further than
this and actually feed them as they do their own larvæ with honey or
something of a similar nature which they regurgitate from their crops
one little beetle—_atemeles_ by name—is extremely fond of such a meal
and solicits it from the ants by stopping in front of them and assuming
a certain attitude accompanied with insinuating motions of the antennæ
whether _atemeles_ is able to feed itself or must live wholly upon
these ministrations i am not quite sure; but another beetle—poor
_clavigertestaceus_—is according to janet so entirely dependent upon
the ants for subsistence that if separated from them he has nothing to
do but to die
                               chapter iv
    ant parasites—fleet-footed brigands—honey-stealing mites—a
      strange table companion—privileged cockroaches—ants and
      their riders—a fly-ride on beetle-back
leaving the beetles—though as there are probably some thousands that
live habitually in ants’ nests we have said very little about them—we
may glance at an extraordinary little creature in appearance something
like a wood-louse with a fish’s tail that resides with certain ants on
the footing of a freebooter constantly stealing from them and eluding
their resentment by extreme activity living as it were in a state of
perpetual motion the legs of these persistent yet withal timid brigands
are many and long which together with their shape and general
lightness of build enables them to run with great speed so that they
easily outdistance the ants and escaping to some less frequented part
of the nest with which they are always well acquainted remain there
quiet for a time should a single ant approach them however they
immediately run away or if forced by circumstances to be near one or
more—which in an ants’ nest must be often difficult to avoid—make a
point apparently of never keeping still as though to confuse them
or perhaps to be the better able to dash off at any instant
    the extraordinary looking insect shown towards the top is the
      lepismid or fleet-foot who lives by stealing food from
      ants when they are in the act of passing it from one to the
      other the atemeles beetle shown below is begging food
      which will not be refused from the ant in front of him
the way in which these fleet-foots secure their food is highly
remarkable each little theft—which has about it more of the parasite
than the brigand—occasioning a group of three the ants upon which they
live are of the species known as _lasius umbratus_ and like many other
kinds often feed one another the hungry asking of the full by whom he
is rarely if ever denied in the process of regurgitation—with which
we are now familiar—the two stand fronting each other with mandibles
interlocked and a drop of honey passes from mouth to mouth for an
instant it trembles between the two resting on both and that instant
is the opportunity of the _lepismid_ darting forward he interposes his
own and having absorbed some portion of the drop _in transitu_ speeds
swiftly away to make a third elsewhere such a life however great may
be the thief’s agility is full of danger and from time to time an
individual is captured and killed in nests under observation such
executions may be witnessed and _lepismid_ corpses—or as various
professors prefer calling them _cadavers_—are sometimes noted under
artificial conditions however opportunities of escape are much more
limited unless indeed some special provision is made thus when
professor wheeler first introduced a colony of _lasius umbratus_ into
one of his _formicariums_ he found after a couple of _dies_[] five
_lepismid cadavers_ but having by the addition to the said
_formicarium_ of a _refugium_ or asylum made it more as _in natura_
this mortality ceased and the remaining _lepismids_ continued
henceforth _existentes_
a similar mode of feeding but under circumstances of much greater
security is indulged in by _antennophorus_ another ant-guest whose
relations with its host are of a still closer description
_antennophorus_ is a mite which according to m janet fixes itself on
to the head or the sides of the abdomen of the ant which it affects
and clings there as long as it sees fit this it is enabled to do owing
to a special adaptation of the feet which end in little horny cups
(_cornicula_ is the word here) furnished with some substance of so
adhesive a quality that it might well be called “stickphast” if no
latin word were at hand not all the feet however are of this
description for the anterior ones are transformed into a pair of long
waving antennæ which contain olfactory organs of the greatest
sensibility with these their owner makes up for the want of eyes and
smelling and feeling its way walks when it wishes to along the bodies
of its hosts passing from one to another sometimes either by accident
or otherwise it becomes detached and is then helpless as far as
locomotion is concerned but by no means so in other respects its
object now is to reaffix itself: nor is it long before it succeeds in
doing so as it “lies upon the soil in one of the galleries of the nest
it raises and stretches forward its first pair of ambulatory feet and
at the same time explores the space around it with its long antenniform
ones these appendages are much more agitated when an ant passes close
by should it pass near enough the _acarid_ (which has a finer sound
than ‘mite’) glues itself on to its body by means of the cup of sticky
material at the end of one of its ambulatory feet which it holds up
ready for this operation and it can in this way soon climb up and fix
itself in a good position on its host the latter is surprised and
seeks to rid itself of its strange companion but failing in this it
becomes resigned very quickly (as we do to increased taxation) as soon
as the _acarid_ has taken up one of its normal positions”[] it will
carry two indeed or even three without complaining an ant with one of
these burdens fixed like the income-tax to the under side of its head
and two others which may stand for a rise in tea and sugar is a very
common sight
the feeding of _antennophorus_ has been closely observed by m janet in
his artificial nests and is thus described by him: “the ants had
acquired a habit of placing themselves crowded one against another in
one corner of the nest and thither came such as had their crops well
filled after a meal of honey and disgorged it before the mouths of
their comrades who had none while the fasting ant was eating the honey
thus disgorged _antennophorus_ riding on its head took its share to
do this it pushed itself forward and thrust its rostrum into the
droplet and generally whilst holding itself in position by means of
the two hinder pairs of legs it attached itself by means of the forward
pair (which in this case however would represent antennæ) to the head
of the disgorging ant”[] perhaps there is some little mistake
here—possibly i have not copied the passage correctly there has been no
hint before as to the modified antenniform legs of the parasite
performing any other office than that of feeling and smelling whilst
the word “attach” or “affix” is that always used to describe the working
of the sticky cup-footed ones in the position described the antennæ
might very well act as supports but hardly one would think in such a
way as that their owner could be described as attaching himself through
their means possibly it is the first pair of true legs that act in this
way but the matter is of no great consequence—not more than a war say
or the fall of a ministry in the general run of things suffice it that
we have our picture the little parasite stretched like a bridge
between the heads of the feeding and disgorging ants and taking its
share with the latter
_lasius something_ is the name of the ant which _antennophorus_ utilises
in this way and it is i think a european species another
one—_pachycondyla harpax_—the large black ant of america—wears its
parasite round its neck like an elizabethan ruff in this case both
host and guest are in the larval state and the involuntary partnership
between them—involuntary probably on the part of either—is not dissolved
until both have attained full maturity the position of affairs is this:
the ant larva apparently lies on its back upon earth a little hollowed
to receive it by the workers of the nest the parasitic larva—that of
an unknown species of fly—has a long slender neck as we may call the
anterior part of the body and whilst this is wound about the
corresponding portion of its host the body which broadens out after
the manner of an oil-flask is affixed by a disc at its end to some part
of the back of the latter when the ants feed the larvæ they place the
food—which consists either of grain that has been stored or of insects
captured and torn up by them—on the broad surface of the abdomen which
forms a sort of trough for its reception immediately upon feeling the
welcome load the hungry larva stretches down its head to the banquet
but that of the parasite moves with it and its small sharp jaws take
eager toll of each dish thus the two feed together cheek by jowl and
should what has been provided prove insufficient for this double
onslaught the unbidden guest will stretch its snake-like neck and move
it ceaselessly until the ever-ready jaws come into contact with a second
feast upon the table next it should none however be within reach
the guest will give vent to its irritated feelings by biting the bodies
of such unbounteous timons or even that of its own host they wriggle
with pain and this may possibly induce the ants to bring them fresh
supplies under the impression that they are hungry as indeed they may
be with meals shared in this way if so we can hardly suppose a
parasitic larva to act with such a motive but as the best biters would
in this case get the most food natural selection may possibly have
helped to develop the habit which would have a compensating advantage
for the wrigglers too as the french say “_il y a compensation en
tout_”
the parasite whilst stretching out as far as it can from the body of
its host in quest of food remains all the while attached to the
latter by the disc in which its body ends it can however leave one
ant larva for another though professor wheeler to whom we owe this
interesting discovery believes that it does this “with great
reluctance and only under urgent circumstances such as extreme hunger
the death of the larva to which it is attached and perhaps when fully
mature and about to pupate”[] so long indeed as its original host
on whose body when quite young it was probably hatched from the egg
continues well and is well fed it has no reason to seek farther since
all its wants are provided for it is not only fed by the worker ants
but shares in any other of the benefits which these may bestow upon the
rising generation of the nest thus if they move larvæ as is
customary to give them change of temperature and produce the requisite
hygienic conditions the parasite is moved along with them and it is
cleaned also—a still more important advantage possibly—at the same time
as they are at such times the ants never seem to notice the uncouth
incubus upon the bodies of their infant sisters though one would
suppose the difficulty would be not to do so they are it is true
blind or nearly so but it seems strange that their sense of touch
which is no doubt delicate should not be able to inform them since the
parasite though small enough absolutely is of great size regarded as
an excrescence on its host’s body this probably is the way in which the
matter presents itself to the ants if they think about it at all for
since the two lives are passed constantly together and are subjected to
the same conditions it is likely that they share one smell between
them
but this curious parasitic relation between ant and fly is not confined
to the larval stage of each continued observation led to a further
discovery which i give in professor wheeler’s own words: “as the days
passed the mature ant-larvæ spun their brown cocoons one by one and
one by one the mature commensals (the larval parasites that is to say)
disappeared no traces of them could be discovered the only remaining
resource was to open the cocoons five were opened and in two of recent
formation commensals were found! having shared the table of their host
they had come to share its bed as well the dipteron (the parasite as i
have said is a fly) had pupated after the manner of its kind forming a
puparium that is instead of spinning a cocoon like the ant larva: the
dead larval skin somewhat shrivelled and contracted was used as an
envelope and within this the pupa proper was found in all cases the
puparium was located in the caudal pole (at the bottom) of the ant
cocoon and was immovably stuck to the wall of the cocoon its anterior
end directed towards the cephalic pole”[] (the top) but what asks
professor wheeler does the commensal larva do “while the ant-larva is
weaving its cocoon does it move about to avoid the swaying jaws of the
spinning larva or does it take up its position from the first at the
posterior end of the larval ant and there remain motionless while the
posterior pole of the cocoon is being completed it is very difficult to
answer these questions”[]
one might think that young ants thus deprived day by day of a portion
of every meal would be stunted in their growth and not make such large
and healthy workers as those who had never been encumbered with a
parasite this however does not seem to be the case and no difference
can be detected between the one and the other perhaps therefore ants
habitually eat if not more than is good for them at least more than
they require this is the case almost universally amongst civilised men
at least in northern europe and with savages to a still greater extent
whenever the wherewithal is at hand in the above case we have as
professor wheeler remarks a very perfect example of what is termed
commensalism in the original meaning of the word—that is to say of two
or more individuals dining together at the same table as applied to
natural history the individuals in question must be of different
species but it is not often that the definition otherwise is so
rigorously adhered to
this curious parasite inhabits the nests or more strictly speaking
the bodies of an ant native to texas that has long been famous as a
storer of grain but whose supposed still further achievements in an
agricultural direction would now seem open to doubt in the nest of
another american ant which most certainly does grow mushrooms the same
observer found another “_myrmecophile_” or ants’ nest insect viz a
minute species of cockroach that lives its life amongst the caves and
galleries of the great vegetable mass which forms and is designed to
form the mushroom bed upon the product of which it feeds here again
the ants have become thoroughly reconciled to the presence amongst them
of a guest from which as far as can be seen they derive no benefit
whilst having to submit to a loss through its agency of some part of
the fruits of their labours these little cockroaches are fairly
numerous and have become so adapted to living in darkness that their
eyes have almost disappeared another loss or partial loss is of a
more curious nature and one might think would be a great privation to
them their antennæ namely are always incomplete but this does not
seem to have come about by a gradual process of atrophy but rather to
have been caused by mutilation during their owners’ lifetime but how
has this happened and what has been the mutilating agency professor
wheeler’s explanation which he believes to be the only one is that
their antennæ have been unconsciously sheared off by the ants whilst
engaged either in clipping their mushrooms or in cutting up the pieces
of leaves which they are continually bringing into the nest to add to
the bed on which they grow “it is easy” he says “to understand how an
insect like a cockroach living in the midst of thousands of ants which
are continually opening and closing their scissor-like mandibles should
be certain sooner or later to have its long antennæ cropped one
wonders how the tarsi (the legs that is to say) of the cockroach escape
the same treatment”[] this wonder however if there is really any
reason for it suggests a doubt as to the sufficiency of the explanation
here offered the antennæ one would think might be held high in which
case if sheared at all it could only be at the base but if here (as
would not however seem to be the case) why should not the legs be
sheared too again it seems possible that the insects themselves may be
in the habit of gnawing one another’s antennæ as the cockroaches live
and flourish it would seem that this mutilation of their antennæ if
that indeed be the explanation can do them no great injury yet these
organs are supposed to be of great importance to insects and judging
by their length and delicacy one would think that they were especially
so to the members of the cockroach family in this case they would
probably be extremely careful of them and the fact that these
ants’-nest cockroaches do not seem to be so may show that subterranean
conditions contrary to what one might have expected have affected
their efficacy
    enjoyment seems to be the only motive the fly has for riding
      on the back of the african beetle shown in the upper part of
      this illustration beneath is shown the well named honey-pot
      ant with its distended body full of honey which it gives
      away to any hungry working ant
a diet of mushrooms or fungus is not the only thing for which these
little blind light-shunning cockroaches are indebted to their
landlords the ants for often one of them may be seen to mount upon one
of the latter and take a ride on its back they seem especially fond of
the soldiers as horses and will sit perched on their enormous heads
as they walk up and down in a stately sort of way sometimes for quite a
long time enjoyment seems here to be the only motive and perhaps it is
a natural one since there is a fly in africa which seems to have quite
a passion for riding on the back of a beetle “across the mouth of the
seyhouse” says the rev mr eaton “on sandy pasture-land bordering the
seashore big _coprophagous_ beetles—it sounds abusive but no harm is
meant—are common sheltering in large holes in the soil when at rest
and running about on business a small species of _borborinæ_ (that is
the fly) may often be seen riding on their backs chiefly on the
pronotum and about the bases of the elytra sometimes half a dozen
females on one beetle the beetles occasionally throw themselves on
their backs and try to get rid of them by rolling; but the flies elude
all their efforts to dislodge them dodging out of harm’s way into the
jointures of the thorax and darting from back to breast and back
again in a way that drives the beetle nearly mad in vain she scrapes
over them with her legs in vain does she roll over or delve down
amongst the roots of the herbage: the flies are as active as monkeys
(not perhaps a very striking simile here) and there is no shaking them
off it is difficult (such is their strange predilection) to get them
off into the killing-bottle nothing (not even the killing-bottle)
persuades them to fly and they would very much rather stick to the
beetle than——” what not go to heaven but “be driven off it down the
tube”[] the tube must be the neck of that same bottle this surely
is a case of infatuation if ever there was one eccentric fly! and what
must be the charms of a beetle that can prevail over those of cyanide of
potassium! but the beetle it must be remembered is a _coprophagous_
one there may be a world of explanation in a word like that
                               chapter v
    from biped to quadruped—flies that borrow
      wings—sit-o’-my-head—a novel cradle—flies that kill
      bees—nature’s sadness—consolations of the future—the tachina
      fly and the locust
although from the way in which the story is told one might imagine that
the fly here was merely enjoying a ride upon beetle-back yet from the
efforts made by the latter to shake off its persecutors and still
more because these were of the female sex the probability is that we
have here to do with a case of parasitism the fly we may almost feel
certain was endeavouring to lay its eggs and the reason why she took
so long about it was that she required a certain spot upon the beetle in
order to do so and that the beetle’s efforts though appearing futile
were more or less successful in guarding this spot at any rate if this
was not the case here it is so in many other instances various flies
being parasitic on various other insects not all of these are fatal to
the object of their choice which if it affords them board as well as
lodgings may only do so to the extent of its blood such are the
curious family of _hippoboscidæ_ or bird ticks who begin life with
wings but are so little appreciative of the powers which these confer
that having found the creature upon whom they elect to live they bite
them off or otherwise wilfully rid themselves of them after the manner
of ants and termites thus offering yet another example in the insect
world of
                        “one whose hand
                  like the poor indian flung a pearl away
                  richer than all his tribe”
for what can be imagined more glorious to possess speaking of physical
attributes than the power of flight
the course of life of these flies—if all be truth that is spoken of
them—is indeed very extraordinary for during the first or winged
stage of their adult life they live on birds but migrate from them to
some quadruped—as say a deer—as soon as they find themselves within
easy reach of it and then as having reached their final place of
abode do away with their wings thus being too lazy or lethargic to
fly themselves they choose rather to stand indebted to another being
for a power which they no doubt once possessed in perfection and which
they are still quite capable of exercising what the larval stage of
these flies is whether they lay their eggs upon their first or last
habitation—or on both and if not where or in what manner the larva
passes its life i do not know and as my authority who should be up to
date holds his peace upon the matter i conclude that it is not yet
made out possibly the grub is a vegetable feeder or possibly again
it is as fatal to some other insect as is that of a little fly with a
big name—_apocephalus pergandei_ to wit—to ants the victim here
chosen—if there be not others also—is a black tree-climbing ant common
in pennsylvania as it runs over the ground or up and down the trunks of
trees the fly darts after it on tiny wings intent on laying her egg
upon its neck the ant tries to elude her endeavours but
_apocephalus_—or sit-o’-my-head—has a mission to fulfil and will take
no denial the egg is laid it cannot be detached and when hatched
the issuing grub bores with enthusiasm into the head of the ant
coming to the brain he has nothing to do but to eat it and he does so
until the whole cavity of the skull has become an empty chamber except
for his own presence there the movements of the ant during this
process—of its feelings we have no record—have become more and more
erratic and it feels itself less and less capable of performing its
duties as a member of an active and industrious community at length it
falls down and not long afterwards its head falls off giving to the
maggot inside it its first opportunity of looking out into the world
through the window of the neck-hole hitherto its life however easy and
pleasant has been of a sedentary nature but now it can enjoy the
pleasures of a walk and moves about something after the manner of a
snail dragging its cephalic shell behind it but this active state is
not of long duration the time of change is at hand and snug within the
ant’s head and its own last larval skin which as is the way with fly
caterpillars serves it in lieu of a cocoon the fortunate little
creature turns into a chrysalis and dreams away its time till on some
sunny day it issues from its cradle a happy active fly feeling
strangely attracted by ants
another little fly belonging to this same family group—the hump-backed
flies or _pharidæ_—has it fate linked with that of bees in whose hive
it is hatched and on whose eggs and larvæ it feeds; nor does the grown
bee itself though armed with its sting escape from the more rapacious
members of the order these are known by the name of robber flies
though as the robbery involves the death of the victim and consists of
the juices of its body murder would seem to be the better word these
flies though of somewhat slender build which the better fits them for
their swift and darting flight are excessively strong as might be
expected from their long muscular-looking legs and rough hairy bodies
all sorts of insects are their prey for the despatch of which they are
furnished with a hard tubular beak enclosing as in a sheath a
lancet-like instrument which being protruded at will severely
lacerates the body of the captive the beak or sheath is also struck
some way into the wound and being tipped with bristles these serve as
so many barbs to keep it in position whilst the blade continues to
probe and hack the victim on whose back the fly has descended
embracing it with its powerful legs “these flies” says dr fitch—who
seems strangely unalive to the moral beauty underlying the mere
mechanical expression of it—“are inhuman murderers they are savages of
the insect world putting their captives to death with merciless
cruelty their large eyes divided into such a multitude of facets
probably give them the most acute and accurate vision for espying and
seizing their prey; and their long stout legs their bearded and
bristly head their whole aspect indicates them to be of a predatory and
ferocious character like the hawk they swoop upon their prey and
grasping it securely between their fore feet they violently bear it
away”[] bees beetles butterflies moths even grasshoppers are thus
treated and sometimes by a beautiful retributive arrangement—enough to
throw one into ecstasies—they turn cannibals and prey upon each other
nay there is even more than this to arouse our admiration for so stern
and unbending is the law of eternal justice that even the softest
feelings of nature are not allowed to interfere with it and the female
wooed by the male is frequently compelled to eat him thus the noble
maxim of _fiat justitia ruat cælum_ though for a time it may seem to
be in abeyance finds at last unconscious expression if not in the
breast at least in the appetite of a cruel and murderous insect; and
thus in the animal world not less than in our human one “the whirligig
of time brings in his revenges”
to bee-keepers—and to bees perhaps still more so—these terrible
buccaneer flies are especially obnoxious poised in air in the
neighbourhood of some hive they watch the issuing and returning stream
and making swift choice of a victim sweep like the wingéd furies that
they are upon him there is a sharp shrilly sound as the bee’s wings
vibrate for a moment more rapidly then the fatal legs wrap her round
and pressed tightly to the oppressor’s body she is borne to some shrub
or flower in the shade or pleasant fragrance of which the juices of her
body are sucked out through a hole specially made to allow of their
passage when nothing remains but the empty shell the fly drops this
and returns to the scene of its labours through all the hot sunny hours
these raids are continued till hundreds of empty bee-shells strew the
ground as the sun declines the sport flags and gradually ceases but it
begins again the following morning as merrily as ever america seems to
be the home _par excellence_ of these flies but they are represented
under various forms in many parts of the world the united states has
been accorded its fair share of them and according to their numbers
each season the labours of the bee-farmer are rewarded or otherwise so
much is this the case that the fact that “during certain seasons in a
bee-raising district of new york not a single hive threw off a
swarm”[] has been attributed to this cause alone
    poised in the air the buccaneer fly selects its victim from
      the bees issuing from a hive pounces on it like a winged
      fury and kills its hapless prey the insect depicted
      beneath is protected from its enemies by its strange
      resemblance to a dead leaf
it would appear from these facts either that no bee ever succeeds in
stinging its assailant or else that the latter is proof against the
injection of poison the former seems to me the most probable since the
system of the bee itself has no such immunity it seems strange that so
deadly a weapon should fail thus constantly at a pinch and it would be
interesting to know if these redoubtable adversaries attack wasps as
well as bees as it is not stated that they do so—as wasps are pointedly
omitted from the list made out of their victims—the contrary may i
think be assumed and also as a corollary that if wasps were attacked
they would be able to use their sting probably with fatal effect this
superior capability is no doubt owing to the superior flexibility of a
wasp’s abdomen over that of a bee; and if we ask ourselves what is the
cause of this—how and for what reason the superiority has been
acquired—the answer seems “as ready as a borrower’s cap” viz “as a
means of self-defence through a process of natural selection” nothing
could be better adapted to bring this process into play than the very
ordeal through which the bee is passing; for if some could only succeed
through superior flexibility in stinging the flies they ought to
increase at the expense of those unable to do so as far as it goes
this seems to point to the wasp having gone through a longer course of
development than the bee—to its ancestry dating farther back in time;
but when we think of the latter’s more elaborate social organisation and
the greater perfection of its cells one feels inclined to reverse this
opinion as no bees possess such powers of twisting about and doubling
round their abdomens as do wasps though some can do so in a very fair
degree it seems probable that the common ancestor of all the species
was more thickly built than that of the wasps or at least that the
potential capacity handed down by it of development in this direction
was less but precisely the same argument may be used in regard to the
brain of the ancestral wasp and thus we see that unless we have
geological evidence on the subject it is very difficult to say which of
two species has the more ancient descent
the robber flies—whose scientific name i have forgotten—however
disagreeable they may be are at least not parasites they attack their
prey and kill it quickly instead of handing it over to prolonged
torture at the hands of the next generation this last is what the
tachina flies—to say nothing of other kinds—do who as they principally
attack caterpillars may be considered beneficial to man in the united
states of america there is no greater destroyer of all sorts of trees
than the so-called army-worm caterpillar or rather grub—for it
represents a fly merely—which gathers together in enormous numbers when
about to enter the pupal state “i have seen” says mr leland howard
“vast armies of the army-worm comprising unquestionably millions of
individuals and have been unable to find a single specimen which did
not bear the characteristic eggs of a tachina fly these flies were
present in such numbers that their buzzing as they flew over the army of
caterpillars could be heard at some distance and the farmers were
unnecessarily alarmed since they conceived the idea that the flies were
the parents of the caterpillars and were flying everywhere and laying
their eggs in the grass and wheat as a matter of fact one great
outbreak of the army-worm in northern alabama in the early summer of
 was completely frustrated by the tachina flies aided by a few
other parasites and predatory insects they also attack grasshoppers
bugs beetles saw-flies and saw-fly larvæ humble bees and wasps (how
they avoid the sting of the latter we are not told; perhaps their
insignificant size is a protection) the eggs are stuck by some sort of
gummy substance to the surface of the preyed-on insect; and the small
white eggs are frequently seen sticking to the back of some unfortunate
caterpillar from the under side of each egg there hatches a little
maggot which bores its way through the skin of the host and penetrates
into its body where it lives nourishing itself upon the fatty matter
and lymph until it reaches full growth usually if not always
destroying before it emerges some vital organ so as to cause the death
of the host insect it almost invariably issues when full grown from
the body of the insect attacked and pupates at or near the surface of
the ground within the last larval skin which hardens into a brown oval
puparium”[] there are some points of special interest about the
parasitism of these tachina flies which seem to be directed by a less
perfect instinct than that which guides other insects of similar habits;
for instance the ichneumon flies which however are such merely in
name being members of the order _hymenoptera_ which includes the bees
and ants
these latter by merely touching an insect with their antennæ can tell
if it is already occupied—in which case they withdraw—nor do they ever
lay eggs in excess of the number of issuing larvæ that can be supported
by the little world of provender into which they will be born neither
do they choose a caterpillar to lay on which is just about to cast its
skin by which manœuvre the host would escape and the guests be left to
perish all these mistakes however are frequently made by the tachina
fly the consequence being that many poor children die of starvation;
whilst others from wanting their necessary complement of food have
their growth checked and become poor pitiable objects less than half
the size that with a more generous diet they would certainly have
attained to it is painful to know that such privation exists and to
have no means of relieving it; but nature is full of sadness and it is
best to look truth in the face some comfort may perhaps be derived by
looking forward to a distant future when the instinct which is now
liable to these errors shall have been perfected such comfort at any
rate lives in mr leland howard’s views that “the parasitic mode of
life in the tachina fly is one of comparatively recent acquirement and
that sufficient time has not elapsed since they began to take on this
habit”[] to allow of its having reached the final goal towards which
it is always advancing it is difficult however to console oneself for
the imperfections of a work-a-day world in a far distant prospect of
elysium
in the somewhat numerous list of insects distinguished by the attentions
of the tachina fly grasshoppers have been mentioned in africa they
or at any rate one species of the family attack the terrible plague
locust that has from time to time committed and still apparently
commits such terrible devastations the latter seems quite aware of the
fate in store for it and makes vigorous efforts to evade its destiny
buzzing in the air above the ravenous horde the fly waits for one to
hop or rise on the wing and then darts swiftly upon it to avoid her
the locust rises or sinks tacks suddenly to right or left scudding
this way and that like a ship to meet a varying breeze the tachina in
the meanwhile circles about her quarry awaiting a favourable
opportunity which generally arises just as the locust alights or is on
the point of alighting when descending upon it before the lost impetus
can be renewed she clings lovingly and deposits her eggs either on
the neck or under one of the wings
                       “——and with a little pin
             bores through his castle wall and farewell king”
it is not however as a rule till after the grub or grubs have made
their exit from the body that the locust dies though it has drooped and
become languid for some time of the vast swarms that darken the sky and
descend upon the country like a mantle a very small proportion would
seem to perish in this way since everywhere the females may be seen
drilling with their abdomens into the ground preparatory to laying
their eggs the check upon their numbers whatever it may be—and on the
whole it must be very effective—supervenes for the most part at this
early stage before the egg is hatched that is to say
                               chapter vi
    the burden of the locusts—classical nonsense—address
      to mahomet—locusts in europe—succumb to the english
      climate—described by darwin—locusts in africa—the wingless
      host do greatest damage—hoppers and jumpers—“an army on the
      march”
locusts are insects famous in story and when one reads about them in
various entomological or other writings one might imagine that the
whole world had been doing little else ever since it began than play a
losing match with these creatures it is only after one has gone a
little about the world and lived for some time in regions noted as
their head-quarters without seeing anything whatever of them that one
begins to doubt this view and lean towards another one viz that they
are fabulous animals; but truth as in other cases where two extreme
views are held lies somewhere betwixt and between the whole matter is
this that when one reads one narrative after another with its burden
of a darkened sun devastated territories strong winds drownings in
the sea and pestilences engendered by innumerable carcases cast up
along hundreds of miles of beach the intervals as well as the
countries between each one of these occurrences are annihilated in the
imagination and the dates if seen are forgotten thus to use the
kaffir expression—which has not yet lost its meaning for a civilised
european—one sees everything red; locusts are very convincing—“you may
almost hear the beating of their wings”
however there is no doubt that these insects in relation to man have
played what the germans call “_eine bedeutende rolle_” in the world and
are worth saying something about if only one has something not too
desperately antique to say and this by virtue of a work which i at
any rate have never seen quoted and a paper in a certain antipodean
organ which for the majority of people here might as well be in the
_faerie queene_ or _paradise lost_ i think i may have but first let us
turn to what though it be antique is also classical and—though this
would not be a corollary for everyone—very delightful: “to look” say
the authors of the famous _introduction_ “at a locust in a cabinet of
insects you would not at first sight deem it capable of being the
source of so much evil to mankind as stands on record against it ‘this
is but a small creature’ you would say ‘and the mischief which it
causes cannot be far beyond the proportion of its bulk the locusts so
celebrated in history must surely be of the indian kind mentioned by
pliny which were three feet in length with legs so strong that the
women used them as saws i see indeed some resemblance to the horse’s
head but where are the eyes of the elephant the neck of the bull the
horns of the stag the chest of the lion the belly of the scorpion the
wings of the eagle the thighs of the camel the legs of the ostrich
and the tail of the serpent all of which the arabians mention as
attributes of this widely dreaded insect destroyer but of which in the
insect before me i discern little or no likeness’” personally i do
not for a moment imagine that even in  the date of the first
edition of the work in question any reasonably educated person would
have spoken or thought in this way without any conception apparently
of what numbers can effect but it is interesting to know what the arabs
think or say about the locust and especially that they represent
it—as we are told a few lines on—as thus addressing mahomet: “we are the
army of the great god; we produce ninety-nine eggs; if the hundred were
completed we should consume the whole earth and all that is in it”
the authors then proceed to give a short résumé of the various locust
plagues under which the earth over a large part of its surface has at
different times groaned the first and best authenticated goes back to a
very early period—about  bc—after which the evidence does not
conform quite so strictly to the test demanded of it by the modern
scientific spirit pliny however we are told “mentions a law in
cyrenaica by which the inhabitants were enjoined to destroy the locusts
in three different states three times in the year—first their eggs
then their young and lastly the perfect insect and not without reason
was such a law enacted; for orosius tells us that in the year of the
world  africa was infested by such infinite myriads of these animals
that having devoured every green thing after flying off to sea they
were drowned and being cast upon the shore they emitted a stench
greater than could have been produced by the carcases of  men (a
very confident statement surely) st augustine also mentions a plague
as having arisen in that country from the same cause which destroyed no
less than  persons (_octingenta_ _hominum millia_) in the kingdom
of masanissa alone and many more in the territories bordering upon the
sea” after this we make a jump to ad  and find the locusts in
europe in that year “an infinite army of them of a size unusually
large grievously ravaged part of italy; and being at last cast into
the sea from their stench arose a pestilence which carried off near a
million of men and beasts in the venetian territory also in  more
than  persons” (but this seems pitiful) “are said to have perished
in a famine occasioned by these terrific scourges”
many other instances of their devastations in europe in france spain
italy germany etc are recorded by the same authors “in  a cloud
of them was seen to enter russia in three different places which from
thence passed over into poland and lithuania where the air was darkened
by their numbers in some places they were seen lying dead heaped one
upon another to the depth of four feet; in others they covered the
surface like a black cloth the trees bent with their weight and the
damage they did exceeded all computation” nay “even this happy island
(_lucus a non lucendo_) so remarkably distinguished by its exemption
from most of those scourges to which other nations are exposed (as fog
sunshine etc) was once alarmed by the appearance of locusts in 
they were observed here in considerable numbers but providentially they
soon perished without propagating”—the “happy island” apparently having
been too much for them these unfortunates would appear to have been
stragglers from far vaster numbers which a year before had devastated
eastern europe one swarm of which “entering transylvania in august
was several hundred fathoms in width at vienna the breadth of one of
them was three miles and extended to so great a length as to be four
hours in passing over the red tower: and such was its density that it
totally intercepted the solar light so that when they flew low one
person could not see another at the distance of twenty paces” another
host that appeared in india is said to have formed a column five hundred
miles long and “so compact was it when on the wing that like an
eclipse it completely hid the sun so that no shadow was cast by any
object and some lofty tombs not more than  yards off were rendered
quite invisible”
dr clarke in his _travels_ speaks of locusts covering “his carriage and
horses and says the tartars assert that people are sometimes suffocated
by them” he mentions two species “the first of which is almost twice
the size of the second and because it precedes it is called by the
tartars the herald or messenger” from  to  a dreadful curse of
locusts alluded to by southey in his “thalaba”—or perhaps forming the
subject of that poem—i really don’t know—fell upon the empire of
morocco “everything green was eaten up not even the bitter bark of the
orange and pomegranate escaping a most dreadful famine ensued the poor
were seen to wander over the country deriving a miserable subsistence
from the roots of plants; and women and children followed the camels
from whose dung they picked the undigested grains of barley which they
devoured with avidity; in consequence of which numbers perished and the
roads and streets exhibited the unburied carcases of the dead” again
“from mogador to tangier before the plague of  the face of the
earth was covered by them at that time a singular incident occurred at
el araiche the whole region from the confines of the sahara was ravaged
by them; but on the other side of the river el kos not one was to be
seen though there was nothing to prevent their flying over it till
then they had proceeded northwards; but upon arriving at its banks they
turned to the east so that all the country north of el araiche was full
of pulse fruits and grain—exhibiting a most striking contrast to the
desolation of the adjoining district” lastly—that is to say to make a
last quotation from the classics—“the arabs of the desert whose hands
are against every man and who rejoice in the evil that befalls other
nations when they behold the clouds of locusts proceeding from the
north are filled with gladness anticipating a general mortality which
they call _el khere_ (the benediction) for when a country is thus laid
waste they emerge from their arid deserts and pitch their tents in the
desolated plains”
darwin in his _journal of researches_ gives the following account of a
flight of locusts: “shortly before we arrived at the village of luxan we
observed to the south a ragged cloud of a dark reddish-brown colour at
first we thought that it was smoke from some great fire on the plains;
but we soon found that it was a swarm of locusts they were flying
northward and with the aid of a slight breeze they overtook us at a
rate of ten or fifteen miles an hour the main body filled the air from
a height of twenty feet to that as it appeared of two or three
thousand above the ground; ‘and the sound of their wings was as the
sound of chariots of many horses running to battle’ or rather i should
say like a strong breeze passing through the rigging of a ship the
sky seen through the advanced guard appeared like a mezzotinto
engraving but the main body was impervious to sight; they were not
however so thick together but that they could escape a stick waved
backwards and forwards when they alighted they were more numerous than
the leaves in the field and the surface became reddish instead of being
green: the swarm having once alighted the individuals flew from side to
side in all directions” at that time—the year was —locusts were
“not an uncommon pest in this country: already during this season
several smaller swarms had come up from the south where as
apparently in all other parts of the world they are bred in the
deserts the poor cottagers in vain attempted by lighting fires by
shouts and by waving branches to avert the attack” this locust darwin
tells us closely resembled the famous _gryllus migratorius_ of the
east—the one that spoke to the prophet—if indeed it was not identical
with it
though these accounts are all interesting in their way they none of
them tell us much—or indeed anything—about the locusts themselves for
which reason i will supplement them with some which have that advantage
and are also in some sort a check or commentary upon the others it is
to be noted that in all these we hear only of flying locusts and
anyone would imagine by reading of them that it was by such and no
others that all the damage was done in africa however and also in
cyprus—from which we may assume that it is the same elsewhere—the case
is widely different writing evidently as a locust expert of the former
country dr æneas munro tells us that it is in their early wingless
state—answering to the caterpillar one though far less differentiated
from the perfect form—that the most terrible the overwhelming injury
is inflicted by these insects of the full-grown flying locusts he says
“to a certain extent they do injure here and there where they select
to settle and feed; but they do not devour everything clean before them
like the army of the larval stage or jumpers”[] of the latter and its
doings _ab ovo_ we have the following interesting account: “when the
tiny creatures issue from their nest they are of a greenish white or
creamy colour about an eighth of an inch in length” and on the day
that they do so “the very dust of the ground which was so still before
now seems to waken into life they begin to move by a process of
twisting or rolling over one another so that for the first few days
they receive the name of twisters within eight or ten days however
they can jump four or six inches and at the age of three or four weeks
a new characteristic makes its appearance a desire to explore manifests
itself and in a surprising manner the whole company moves in a body in
one general direction and more or less in a straight line as if by one
common instinct without apparently having any recognised leader or
commander”[] which is just the way in my opinion that rooks and
starlings move[]
marching in this way they spread themselves out over the country
“eating everything that comes in their way—wheat (if sufficiently young
and tender) maize (even if strong and old) corn sugar-cane linseed
alfalfa (lucerne) pasture of all kinds vegetables of all kinds
(tomatoes and celery) and all garden produce potatoes (ordinary and
sweet) the leaves and sometimes even the bark of the trees causing
their ruin the fruit of course is lost for the season orange
willow poplar palm banana peach pear plum vine acacia roses
etc are stripped” but not “the gum and paradise trees which seem to
be poisonous to them they make everything ‘clean bare’; sometimes they
will enter houses and eat the very clothes and curtains at the
windows”[] they will even eat the wool off the backs of the sheep
and “last stage of all that ends this strange eventful history” on a
pressing occasion they will eat one another continuing his interesting
account—the graphic and convincing one of an eye-witness— dr munro
tells us that “when these hoppers and jumpers (_voetgangers_ as the
boers call them) are on the march they sometimes appear so determined
and bent on the fearful execution of their work that they resemble and
have got the name of ‘an army on the march’ they move in open file and
carry themselves in a proud haughty way with heads high up and fixed
it is beautiful and interesting to see them on the march if we only
divest ourselves for the moment of the idea of their devastating
object”[] and again “the whole of the company begin to walk at the
same time as if by order; the head is kept erect and the neck is as if
stiffened they go straight on irrespective of danger”[] and are
deterred as is well known by hardly any obstacle “the sight of this
army is a very impressive one and once seen will never be forgotten in
some respects it is an awful sight; the spectacle strikes you with pity
and sorrow to see at once before you that the toil and the labour for
the season or indeed the year is lost”[]
“it is in this marching stage” continues dr munro “that the
_voetgangers_ do enormous damage and eat every edible thing in their
path and completely destroy the work of the husbandman they are not
content with levying toll merely but they will have all and will leave
nothing behind but desolation they are therefore unlike the flying
company of locusts which only levy toll here and there but these when
they pass leave nothing”
some curious facts are then given in regard to the uniform
direction—varying according to the country—in which these wingless
locusts march the account will be remembered of how a flying host came
to the banks of a river which they refrained from crossing one might
almost think that a mistake had here been made and that the locusts
were really _voetgangers_ but had they been so the river unless a
large one need not have deterred them—at least they will pass streams
though doubtless great numbers are sacrificed in doing so if however
the stream had run parallel to the direction in which the swarm was
advancing we can understand in the light of what seems to be now
established their not crossing it
                              chapter vii
    the sense of direction—how locusts look flying—follow no
      leader—unanimity of movement—flight by moonlight—roosting at
      night—extirpated in cyprus—the “chinese wall” system—not
      adapted to australia—deference to aboriginal feeling—locusts
      in australia—strange ceremony of egg-laying—inadequate
      explanation
in regard to the faculty of direction with which locusts seem endowed
dr munro says: “the flying locusts in the argentine come from a
northerly direction and the hoppers or creepers march towards the
south although it might be so far as abundance of suitable food goes
to their manifest advantage to go in an opposite direction in certain
countries the direction may be known in this country (south africa) it
will be found that they march towards the south and not towards the
north east or west though either of these directions might have been
better for them the direction may not be true south; it may incline at
one time to the south-east at another to the south-west; but taken as
a whole it will be southwards” and he adds: “if proof be needed that
the ‘_saltonas_’ another name—perhaps the portuguese one—for these
wingless armies march in one direction it is abundantly found in the
experience of the screen and trap or cypriote system of destroying
locusts which is based on this fact and on this alone this is
conclusive demonstration”[]
the distance that these footgangers—to translate almost without
changing the dutch word—go in a day depends upon the amount of food
they find upon the road but fluctuates as a rule between one mile and
two they start about eight o’clock when the sun begins to get hot; and
halt for the night a little before the sun sets dr munro describes the
way in which the female locust before laying her eggs drills a hole in
the hard ground with the disc-like extremity of her abdomen but he
mentions nothing very peculiar in connection with the laying of the eggs
such as characterises the performance of that ceremony by the australian
plague locust as will be mentioned shortly
    the dark cloud is entirely composed of locusts which
      sometimes fill the air from twenty feet to two or three
      thousand feet above the ground the poor people attempt in
      vain by shouts by lighting fires and waving branches to
      avert the attack
the first appearance of these locusts is in enormous hosts which may
sometimes be seen at a distance of from seven to ten miles and then
appear as a black cloud in the clear and rarefied air of south africa
“it is impossible” says dr munro “to estimate the number of locusts
in these clouds but some idea may be formed from the fact that when
they are driven as sometimes is the case in a storm into the sea so
many are washed ashore that they lie on the beach as a bank from three
to four feet thick and from fifty to one hundred miles in length and
the stench from the corruption of their bodies it is affirmed is
sensibly perceived for a hundred and fifty miles inland”[] the aerial
movements of the locusts when they fairly surround one are described
as “curious interesting and pretty” distant vision (more especially
overhead) is impeded on account of their numbers the effect when you
look on them in the sun’s rays resembles “snow falling thickly and
gently” and the sun is only seen as though it were in eclipse “its
light is darkened and shadows cannot then be cast from it”[] the
height at which the swarm flies may be anything between forty feet and
two miles from the ground but as a rule it is not greater than 
feet though from  to  is not uncommon sometimes they fly by
moonlight but this is not their usual practice as in their earlier
wingless state they seem to act by one common impulse which prevents
confusion it is obvious indeed that with such myriads filling the
whole air a leader could neither be perceived nor followed and from my
own observations i am convinced that the same difficulty applies to this
way of explaining the movements of flocks of birds i have never
myself seen any evidence of birds being led by one or more of their
number but much to convince me that when banded together in numbers
their movements are governed by a totally different principle viz that
of thought transference or thought-unity—collective thinking as i have
elsewhere called it—for that is what it most suggests if this is not
the case with locusts what i would ask is the alternative
explanation if great hosts of men be neither led nor of one mind where
to go they must fall into confusion impeding one another’s movements
and this is a law which has to do with numbers merely without respect
to the species of which they are composed it has often been noticed
however that large crowds seem liable to be swayed suddenly by some
common impulse
locusts may fly about a district all day doing but little harm “and at
sundown” says dr munro “the sight becomes interesting beyond
description for the whole company then appear to vie with one another
in order to roost quickly”[] when all have found a resting-place
“every twig branch bush or separate stalk of the corn or wheat or
flax are completely covered and sometimes they stick to each
other”[]—three or four deep even “as far as the eye can see the
surface assumes a brownish-red hue pillars posts or the walls of
houses are all alike to them at the time of roosting for the night”[]
such then is the plague locust of south africa which is when at
maturity about three inches long some years ago however—the exact
date is not given—a larger and handsomer species made its appearance
and is thus referred to in a letter which was sent by “a disgusted
farmer” of grahamstown to one of the south african papers: “the new red
locust which during the last month has spread from the orange river
to the sea coming apparently from the north as well as from natal is
doing terrible damage everywhere fruit-trees are being
destroyed—quince apricot fig orange lemon naartje trees not only
are the leaves eaten but young branches are all barked so that they
are probably killed a splendid crop of mealies covering the whole of
peddie lower albany alexandria and other districts has been entirely
destroyed pumpkin plants are being eaten too vegetables of all
kinds—lucerne cattle-cabbage and kale—are also swept away the locusts
are laying everywhere and no doubt the plague will continue some
years what is the agricultural farmer to do”[] i do not know but
here probably were there locusts he would pick out all such birds as
fed on them and try to get them taken off the list of protected species
shooting them illegally all the while he was petitioning
dr munro’s work was published in  and its principal object was to
induce the south african government to adopt the system of dealing with
the locust plague which had been practised with such entire success in
the isle of cyprus whether this has since been done and with what
results i am unable to say in cyprus however the locusts which from
the year  especially have changed the country from a garden into a
wilderness were in one season almost entirely swept away the method by
which so great a result was effected is the invention of an italian
gentleman—signor matthei by name—resident in the island and is based
upon the inability of the immature locusts the footgangers—probably the
grown ones too but this is immaterial—to crawl up a smooth
perpendicular still more an overhanging surface such a surface was
supplied by a long band of leather glazed and polished surmounting a
strip of calico which was made about four feet high but need not as
it was afterwards found have been more than two this insurmountable
obstacle supported at intervals by sticks set in the ground—not
upright but slanting a little towards the path of the locusts—was set
up over a large area of country like a miniature chinese wall and
proved even more insurmountable at intervals along the inner side of
the barrier deep pits were dug whilst at wider ones stood men provided
with brooms spades brushwood and all else requisite when the locusts
arrived at the chinese wall they climbed up the canvas part of it but
being unable to pass the smooth band of leather they fell down in heaps
and their ever-increasing multitudes soon filled the pits in which they
were buried burnt stamped down or otherwise provided for afterwards
their carcases were dug out and heaped on carts and the pits being
empty again were ready for more in this way two hundred million
quadrillion billions—or something of that sort—of locusts were
destroyed and next year when everything was again ready for them hardly
any appeared by this invention as simple as it is ingenious and
inexpensive the locust plague in cyprus has become a thing of the past
and if the conferrer of so great a benefit was ever not a man of large
fortune let us hope that that has become a thing of the past too for
he must have saved several to the british government if the locusts
after coming to the chinese wall and finding themselves unable to climb
it had turned round and walked in another direction this would have
made a capital instance of intelligence shown by insects—but they did
not do so
with native labour the above system which has been so entirely
successful in cyprus could dr munro makes no doubt be put in
operation in africa; but mr w w froggatt the government entomologist
of australia does not think it adapted for that country writing in
_the agricultural gazette_ of new south wales (march ) mr
froggatt says “though they have been successfully dealt with in cyprus
egypt algeria and india by means of trenches traps and burning in
the hopper state and digging up and destroying the eggs in the earlier
stage in nearly all cases the areas infested were comparatively small;
the labour employed was so cheap that small armies of natives could be
employed at a small cost to destroy them while in several instances an
autocratic government made the natives whether they were inclined or
not work at their plan of destruction” in australia where “whether
they were inclined or not” the natives have been got rid of very much
as though they were locusts—or some less stubborn insects—themselves
this would not do
it was in the summer of  that mr froggatt in consequence of
reports received of the advent of locusts in various parts of the
country left sydney for condobolin on the way there many “mobs”—to use
the australian word—were encountered and numbers of locusts flew in at
the railway carriage windows upon alighting mr froggatt became the
witness of a very interesting spectacle—a ceremony as it may well be
called in which vast numbers of the insects were engaged—of which he
gives the following description:—
“in the open red soil we found them laying their eggs in thousands and
the operation was very remarkable the female set to work by pressing
the tip of her abdomen into the soil and working the plates at the
apex so that she gradually bored a regular circular shaft slightly
over an inch in depth and under a quarter of an inch in diameter the
segments of the abdomen extending and stretching as the work progressed
but the most extraordinary part of the operation was that each female
while boring the chamber to deposit the eggs was attended by two males
each of which rested his head against hers with his antennas resting
over her head and the inner foreleg clasped over the prothorax behind
the base of the head resting like this with the tails of the two
attendant males pointing outwards the three formed a three-rayed star
wherever the business of egg-laying was going on each female and her
attendants were surrounded by a cluster of admiring males averaging
from thirty to fifty in number generally in bunches of fours or fives
forming an irregular ring round them but separated from her by a clear
space of three or four inches in no instance were there ever more than
two males touching the female though we examined thousands of them at
work”[]
what is the meaning of this odd performance—this ceremony as it
appears to me though mr froggatt takes a utilitarian view of it “the
probable and only reason” he remarks “that i can see for the
attendance of the two males upon the egg-laying female is that it
enables her to get a firmer grip of the ground and in fact holds her
in position till she completes her task”[] but why then should the
females of no other species of locust as far as we are aware require
this aid and should not the soil of africa be as hard as that of
australia “i can find” says mr froggatt “no record of this habit in
any of our described species which have the same habits”[] again
besides the two chief actors we have the admiring ring of from thirty
to fifty males who can be of no possible service but whose conduct
shows that they take a strong interest in what the female is doing what
is it too that regulates the number or at any rate the personality
of the assistant males if it is a matter of rendering assistance only
and the two males who do so are bound to the female by no more special
tie than the crowd of interested spectators why do not these or some
of them push forward why is there never any contention between them
these considerations make me think that there is something of a formal
and ceremonious character about these queer proceedings and that they
are governed by the same general law as are certain antics or set
figures amongst birds wherein three individuals take a part what one
requires to know is the courting and marital relations of the male and
female locust before the egg-laying takes place
these little locusts—_epacromia terminalis_ is the specific name—are
only about an inch in length and the male from the description seems
a little brighter than the female which may be due to sexual selection
the female appears to lay nineteen eggs only neither more nor less
which is not so many as one would have expected from the arabian legend
with some other species however the number more conforms to the
statement said to have been made to mahomet
there is no vanity at all in my thinking that this has been an
interesting account of locusts since i myself have had nothing to do
with it in giving a general description from general reading of
things generally known and that have been described scores of times
before one is entitled to use one’s own language and to think
perhaps that one stands at no particular disadvantage in doing so but
when in regard to something specially curious or interesting the
graphic words of an eye-witness are before one the best thing one can
do in my opinion is to copy them out if it be suggested that this is
but a lazy way of writing a book my reply is that a compiler best shows
his industry in the searching out of material the late professor
romanes was alive to this fact and has left us in consequence his
_animal intelligence_—one of the most interesting books that exist in
my opinion—about one-eighth of which or perhaps a little more is
written by himself
                              chapter viii
    locusts and _locustidæ_—the most musical grasshoppers—katydid
      concerts—a much-resembling note—cricket thermometers—cicadas
      and sounding-boards—admired musicians—an appreciative
      audience
locusts as everybody knows belong to the grasshopper family but it
may surprise some who have read the grumblings of the learned over
popular names—white ants hedge-sparrows etc—to find that
entomologists have so managed matters that they do not belong to the
_locustidæ_—which is one of the two groups into which all grasshoppers
are divided—but to the other group there are long-horned grasshoppers
and short-horned grasshoppers the long-horned ones which are not
locusts are all of them _locustidæ_ but none of the _locustidæ_ are
locusts because locusts have short horns entomologists think it would
be absurd to alter this after it has gone on so long a view in which
ornithologists with their _storm_-petrels and hedge-_accentors_ no
doubt agree with them a mere popular name with its roots in the saxon
or celtic can be changed and there an end but scientific nonsense in
latin and begun by linnæus as is generally the case let no man
presume to meddle with
it is amongst the _locustidæ_ that we find the most musical of the
grasshoppers the katydids—so well known and highly appreciated in the
united states—standing on a far higher level in this respect than the
comparatively unmusical locusts not that the _locustidæ_—however
musical—use their long horns for blowing purposes properly speaking
these are only antennæ and function as such the musical apparatus
being situated elsewhere the katydids for instance rasp their fore
wings against each other according to the general idea three times in
succession producing the three syllables ka—ty—did which have given
the insect its name but according to mr scudder[] only twice which
makes either “katy” or “she did”; that is to say as a general rule
for he admits the three on occasions the notes are uttered with great
emphasis and at the rate of some two hundred in the minute the
performance continuing at least in the case of some species all day
and all night long
a number of grasshoppers go by the name of katydids in america but the
general type of the insect is a graceful green fragile-looking
creature with very long slender antennæ and in the female a long
ovipositor at the other end as if to balance matters there are many
species and all or most of them sing both by night and day and what
is very remarkable or at least very interesting they have a
different note for either speaking of one—or rather of a long-horned
grasshopper nearly related to the katydids but not actually a member of
the sisterhood—which he had been watching in the sunshine mr scudder
says: “as a cloud passed over the sun he suddenly changed his note to
one with which i was already familiar but without knowing to what
insect it belonged at the same time all the individuals around whose
similar day-song i had heard began to respond with the night-cry the
cloud passed away and the original note was resumed on all sides”[]
_scudderia angustifolia_ is the name of this little musician so called
perhaps because so sensitive to scudding clouds but the katydids do
more than merely play an individual tune each on his own instrument
they hold concerts at which many join together to make an elaborate
musical display a certain number commencing on one note and others
joining in harmoniously on another there are leaders whose business it
is to hold the time-measure and by a steady insistence on the right
note to draw back any who may happen for a moment to get out of tune
the orchestra is divided into so many companies who support and assist
one another so that the whole makes a concerted harmony in which there
are many different movements as a rule the performance is most
creditable though occasionally the effect is marred by a careless
player before commencing the company always tunes up
possibly it may be thought that there is some mistake here—that things
cannot be quite like this personally i have no knowledge on the
subject—never having been to america—but here is what dr george m
gould says writing in _science_ for october or november probably 
since the number is referred to as “recent” in _nature_ for december th
of that year “as soon as the sun has set and twilight is advancing the
katydids in the trees begin to ‘tune up’ the first notes are scattered
awkward and without rhythm but if no wind is blowing thousands soon
join in and from time to time until daylight breaks there is no
intermission in order to make my description clearer let us suppose
a thousand katydids scattered through the trees to utter their several
notes all at once and call them company a another thousand—company
b—at once answers them and this swing-swong is kept up as i say all
night company a’s note is the emphatic or accented note and is more
definitely and accurately a precise musical note whilst the note of
company b varies from one to five half-tones below the most conspicuous
note being five in the old-fashioned musical terms i learned as a boy
company a is eg clearly and definitely _do_ while the note of
company b is either _la_ or more certainly _sol_ not only is company
a’s note more unisonal and definite but it is firmer more accented
and it seems to me that more insects join in this note than in the
second careful observation has convinced me that no insect of company a
or company b ever joins in the other company’s note the rhythm is
usually perfect unless there is a disturbance by a breeze a sharp gust
upsets the whole orchestra and confusion results but the measured beat
is soon refound in the instants of confusion one can detect the steady
see-saw of certain ones as it were ‘leaders’ or first violinists who
hold the time-measure despite the wind and who soon draw the lost
notes of the others once more into the regular measure or beat i do not
mean to say that by diligent attention one may not at times detect
individuals sawing out of tune stray fellows that are indifferent or
careless but the vast majority usually even without a single
exception if there is no wind or rain thus swing along hour after
hour in perfect time i have counted the beats several times and find
the number is always identical: thirty-four double beats or sixty-eight
single ones in sixty seconds the effect of the rhythm upon the mind is
not unlike that of the woodman’s cross-cut saw handled by two steady
tireless pairs of hands although the katydids give a larger volume of
sound and the _timbre_ is harsher” such is the account and upon it
dr gould asks two questions: “what function does the orchestration
subserve” and “is there anything comparable to it among other animals”
in view of these performances of the katydids one may perhaps question
the statement often made that crickets are _the_ most musical of all
insects the snowy cricket however of the united states and no doubt
elsewhere in america is a very striking performer especially at night
when it emits sounds which nathaniel hawthorne has likened to “audible
stillness” and of which he says: “if moonlight could be heard it would
sound like that” thoreau describes it as a “slumbrous breathing” but
according to the state entomologist of the united states this
“slumbrous breathing” or “audible stillness” consists of “a shrill
re-teat re-teat re-teat” which mr leland howard[] indeed thinks
the best description but is not quite my idea—nor probably
hawthorne’s—of how moonlight would sound harrington—who i suppose is
another entomologist—does not interfere with any of these opinions but
describes something which he has seen and can find nothing about in
books “while the male” he says “is energetically shuffling together
his wings raised almost vertically the female may be seen standing
just behind him and with her head applied to the base of the wings
evidently eager to get the full benefit of every note produced”[] no
doubt the female likes the notes—that indeed is the _rationale_ of
their utterance—but what they are really like it is impossible to make
out from these various descriptions another of which by the way is “a
rhythmic beat” possibly they are no more extraordinary (at any rate
“re-teat” is not) than those of our own and cheerful house-cricket
which to my ear have always sounded very pretty but which cowper
evidently did not care about except as a matter of association since he
thus alludes to them in the _task_:—
          “sounds inharmonious in themselves and harsh
           yet heard in scenes where peace for ever (sic) reigns
           and only there please highly for their sake”
no doubt there are associations though these belonging to the kitchen
appear to me to be of another and blither description but the “sounds”
themselves in my opinion are neither harsh nor inharmonious as far as
any unpleasantness to the ear is conveyed by the last word
one interesting point about the song of crickets is that the number of
notes uttered in any given space of time—per minute say—varies
according to the temperature the two rising together professor
dolbeare was the first as far as i know to call attention to this
fact and he is thus confirmed by a lady: “one cool evening a cricket
was caught and brought into a warm room in a few minutes it began to
chirp nearly twice as rapidly as the out-of-door crickets its rate very
nearly conformed to the observed rate maintained on other evenings under
the same temperature conditions (as now indoors) from this series of
observations we found that the rate of chirping was as professor
dolbeare says very closely dependent on the temperature”[] so the
crickets are little thermometers—sixty-three degrees fahrenheit to one
hundred chirps per minute
as we have seen the katydids give concerts and we may therefore infer
that they like their own music in a musically appreciative way; that
they listen to each other as critical connoisseurs whether they have
other feelings or not and that it is not a mere matter of the female
alone admiring the sounds made by the male just because _he_ makes
them in all this however the admiration is confined—at least as far
as we know—to one species—that to which the musician belongs katydids
appreciate the performances of katydids but there is one group of
performers whose music gives satisfaction not merely to individuals of
other species than their own but to such as are not even included in
the same order with them so that racial pride or family prejudice
cannot be the reason of it towards these stars we will now turn our
gaze
all who have lived in the more southern parts of the world including
the southern countries of europe must have made the acquaintance of the
cicadas for in these regions they are large insects conspicuous by
their appearance when once seen and by their song long before they are
noticed there is something very uncouth—one might almost say
grotesquely humorous—yet at the same time pleasing and lovable about the
broad flat heads and great goggle eyes of these insects in the which it
is easy to imagine some quaint sort of expression that seems to mean or
suggest something for which the language supplies no word their wings
both long and broad which when folded project far beyond the
extremity of the abdomen concealing everything save the great head and
the wide shield or boss of the thorax help also in giving them a most
salient and characteristic appearance and make them look more aerial
than they really are their legs whilst they retain their ordinary
resting attitude are entirely hidden and so too are the organs of the
mouth which combine to make a sharp-pointed beak thus their appearance
is typical of air and sunshine and anything so gross as mere feeding or
terrestrial locomotion seems foreign to their nature the ancients who
loved and admired the cicadas extremely thinking them the most
fortunate of creatures supposed that they lived entirely on dew
                    “oh tettix drunk with sipping dew
                     what musician equals you”
sings anacreon or someone who imitated him and wrote very gracefully
for tettix was a common greek name for the cicada really they live on
the sap of the trees on which they sit and there may even be two
opinions about their music to me it is pleasant enough—full of the joy
of the sunshine as it were and its loudness and the continuous way in
which it goes on excites one’s wonder in regard to the way in which it
is produced darwin says at page  of his immortal work _the descent
of man_: “the sound according to laudois who has recently studied the
subject is produced by the vibration of the lips of the spiracles
which are set in motion by a current of air emitted by the tracheæ it
is increased by a wonderfully complex resounding apparatus consisting
of two cavities covered with scales hence the sound may truly be called
a voice in the female the musical apparatus is present but very much
less developed than in the male and is never used for producing sound”
as the greeks who must have had their observers used to say—
                   “happy the cicadas’ lives
                    since they all have voiceless wives”
this sounds all right—i mean the account of the apparatus—but according
to dr powell of new zealand it is all wrong writing in the
_transactions of the new zealand institute_[] dr powell after
quoting the above passage says “i am of course ignorant of the
details of his description; but unless the cicada which he describes
differs essentially in the nature of its musical organs from those found
in new zealand and also from those described more or less correctly by
other authors especially réaumur he is most certainly in error” dr
powell then after telling us that the stridulating organs of the
cicada are constructed on a principle unique in nature viz a vibrating
membrane continues: “in the male on the upper surface of the first
ring of the abdomen on either side may be seen a crescent-shaped
opening and on examining this opening with a magnifying-glass it will
be seen to lead into a shallow cavity closed in by a horny membrane
this membrane is highly elastic and the sound is produced by the
contraction of the muscle straightening out the folds of the membrane;
this produces a click and on the muscle relaxing the membrane from
its elasticity springs back with another click” that this is really
the way in which the sounds are produced seems proved by the fact that
“if a live insect be caught and these membranes be observed during the
act of stridulation they will be seen to be vibrating rapidly in time
with the beats of the shrill sound”
but what about the “wonderfully complex resounding apparatus consisting
of two cavities covered with scales” after a full examination and
various experiments dr powell arrives at the unexpected conclusion
that the sound is in no way dependent upon these “large transparent
drum-like membranes” as he calls the cavities in question i was “much
surprised” he says “to find that the large drums seemed to take no
part in the production of the sound and the idea occurred to me that
they might be hearing organs; but on examining the females which are
dumb and do not possess the stridulating organs i found that the drums
exist indeed but are quite rudimentary instead of being large as we
should expect to find them were they subservient to the sense of
hearing” if however the drums did answer the purpose of a resounding
apparatus in the male we should expect to find them exactly as they are
in the female and so strong does the evidence of their suppression in
her appear to me that i cannot help thinking that in spite of all dr
powell’s observations and experiments he was somehow mistaken and that
in nature they do act in this way
as to the quality of the sound produced by the cicada—of its song as we
may call it—this varies greatly in the different species for there are
many cicadas speaking of that of the largest—the great _pomponia
imperatoria_ of borneo—as big as a mouse one may almost say mr
annandale remarks “the sound produced by this species is at the
beginning of the song like the winding up of a large clock and ends by
being comparable to the notes of a penny whistle between these extremes
it rises in a series of trills each of which concludes with a kind of
click each section of the song is faster louder and clearer than the
one which preceded it until almost five minutes after the cicada’s
settling the noise suddenly comes to an end as the insect flies off to
another tree where it commences again”[] this great pompous imperial
insect—to give it a free rendering of its latin name—sits shrouded in
the mysteries of the deeper jungle while smaller and less majestic
babblers haunt its skirtings and the village groves “another species
commonly heard at night in the jungle has a clear loud clarion-like
call which can be heard for a great distance”[]
of the three new zealand species of cicada—or those found in
canterbury—a large and small green and a black one the two first dr
powell tells us say “crrrk-crrrk-crrrk” the second “r-r-r-r-r-r” and
the third “crrrk-rrrrr” _ad infinitum_ “many persons” he adds “are
totally unable to hear the voice of the small green cicada or any very
acute sounds and inasmuch as the entire range of the human ear is
according to helmholtz eleven octaves it has been justly remarked that
the air may be filled with shrill insect sounds which may be perfectly
audible to the insects themselves but absolutely inaudible to our
grosser senses”[]
it is in natal—at least the fact has been observed there—that the
cicadas as they sing are listened to by admiring groups of other
insects these appear to be beautiful creatures having wings of a
soft gauzy texture but iridescent and shot with the colours of the
rainbow a band of these radiant attendants consisting sometimes of a
dozen or fifteen fly to the tree where a cicada is sitting and
arrange themselves in a semicircle around it facing its head they
are “all ear” evidently and as the sweet sounds continue one or
other of the listeners will advance and touch the antennæ or legs of
the object of its admiration such marks of appreciation however
though flattering in proportion to their undoubted sincerity are not
to the taste of the cicada who will sometimes whilst in the midst of
its song strike out vigorously with a foot or so—for of course it
has six—causing its too obtrusive admirers to retreat to a more
respectful distance where they continue to listen with every sign of
being extremely pleased[] some years ago we did not even know the
name of these musical-connoisseur-like and withal very beautiful
insects but now they have been identified by mr kirby at the
british museum as _nothochrysa gigantea_ so we are all much the
wiser and have a weight lifted from our minds
                               chapter ix
    a greek mistake—nature vindicated—cicadas provided for—a
      difficult feat—perseverance rewarded—cicadas in story—dear
      to apollo—men before the muses—plato and socrates—athenian
      views—a mausoleum for pets—the greek ploughman—apollo’s
      judgment—hercules’ bad taste—modern survivals—a beneficent
      insect—elementary education in tuscany
the greeks thought that the life of the cicadas was all joy but modern
research has been successful in removing the reproach of inconsistency
from the general scheme of creation all is in order as it now appears:
the cicada’s case has been considered and a very handsome wasp provided
for it at least i think it is handsome it is large and strong i
know as is necessary for the part it has to perform but i cannot quite
remember the colours it flies under; an expression which though
metaphorical may be pardoned since flags have much to do with such
dramas as that now to be described for as the joyous sun-loving
creature sits in its accustomed place chirupping forth those shrill yet
musical notes which i at least have never wearied of the destroyer is
at hand and settling on its broad back curves its abdomen beneath that
of the poor blithe singer and in a moment has done its work as the
sting enters the happy note that has been sounding regularly for the
last hour perhaps is changed to a discordant scream of pain and with
a spasmodic spring or flutter—the last or near the last that it will
ever make—the cicada with the wasp still clinging to it falls to the
ground this is awkward for the wasp who doubtless considers herself
aggrieved in the matter since the cicada is so bulky that powerful as
she is she can neither lift it from the ground in flight nor is she
prepared to drag it all the way to her burrow what then is she to do
or of what use to her is the prize she has obtained with such
adroitness but she has her plan and though the captious behaviour of
the cicada has for the moment a little deranged it it is not
permanently frustrated slowly but with firm insistence she drags her
victim to the tree on which a moment before it was so happily seated
and then exerting all her force begins to mount the trunk with it
often she has to pause and rest often it seems as though the task would
be beyond her but she continues the laborious ascent sometimes for
upwards of an hour until at last a height has been reached at which it
is possible for her to put her great project into execution this is no
other than to fly down obliquely with her victim clasped in her arms
to the pleasant little sarcophagus which she has previously prepared for
it for though flight upwards or in a straight line with such a
burden is out of the question her strength is equal to this it is
necessary however that she should balance the body nicely and make a
fair and uninterrupted start in order not to be overweighted and again
fall her enterprise is “full of poise and difficult weight” and cannot
be successfully carried out in face of the rude struggles of a tiresome
obstructive not “in tune with the infinite” these struggles however
have now ceased; the cicada is in a comatose condition and having
adjusted it properly and assumed the requisite attitude and position
our wasp—whose scientific name by the way is _sphecius
speciosus_—launches herself with “the white man’s burden” she has
“taken up” from her coign of vantage and reaches home with it in
safety how high she has previously ascended the tree i cannot say
since my informant does not but it would be interesting to ascertain
both this and the average distance which she has to fly to her nest and
to compare the one with the other unless the latter is very much
greater than the former—and as the journey is constantly downwards it
cannot one would think be very far—then we must see in the wasp’s
choice of a toilsome ascent up a perpendicular tree-trunk in preference
to a horizontal journey along the ground a triumph of instinct over
intelligence and it is indeed quite possible that having always been
accustomed to fly back with her prize which perhaps was not always so
heavy she should go through as much labour to enable her to do this as
differently directed would attain the end for which it is employed
    after the wasp has killed the cicada they both fall to the
      ground strong as the wasp is it is not easy for her to
      carry such a heavy insect to her nest but she has her plan
      slowly but persistently she drags her victim to a tree-trunk
      and up it though it may take her an hour to reach the
      requisite height then she sails off for her nest on an
      inclined plane with wings extended and her victim clasped
      in her arms
the burrow of this wasp consists we are told “of a gently sloping
entrance extending for about six inches when ordinarily a turn is
made at right angles and the excavation is continued for six or eight
inches farther ending in a globular cell an inch and a half in
diameter frequently a number of branches leave the main burrow at about
the same point each terminating in a round cell”[] in each of these
cells either one or two cicadas are deposited and it would seem that
when there are two only one of these is provided with an egg so that
some of the wasp-larvæ have double rations as the female _speciosus_
(her arguments i think would need to be specious to make one in love
with a scheme in which she plays such a part) is very much larger than
the male it seems more than probable that the female eggs are laid in
the chambers which contain two cicadæ and the male ones in those which
accommodate a single one only if so then these solitary wasps must
have the same control over the sex of the eggs laid by them as the queen
bee has the social ones should this be the case no doubt have too
but as the former must have preceded the latter it would appear that
this power has not been developed to meet the needs of a complex state
of society—as has been generally supposed—but in accordance with much
more simple conditions the fact however if it be one has not yet
been demonstrated
“the delicate white elongate egg of the wasp is laid under the middle
leg of the cicada and when it hatches the larva protrudes its head and
begins at once to draw nourishment from between the segments of its
victim the egg hatches in two or three days and the larva attains full
growth in a week or a little more it feeds entirely from the outside
and when full-grown spins a white silken cocoon (mixed with much
earth however) which is finished at the expiration of two days it
remains in the cocoon unchanged through the winter transforming to
pupa only in the following spring and shortly before the appearance of
the true insect when the adult hatches it gnaws its way out of the
cocoon and so on up through the burrow to the surface of the ground
thus completing its life-round in a full year”[] how long exactly
the life of the cicada lasts after it has entered into hospitable
relations with the _speciosus_ i am unable to say
such then is the end of the cicada in spite of the love of apollo
who according to the anacreontic ode bestowed upon it its shrill song
thus it dies though “cherished by the muses painless and fleshless
almost equal to the gods” whether it be fleshless _speciosus_ in the
larval state best knows (on the latter point there will have been no
means of comparison) that it is painless one can only hope it is
something however to be so known to fame homer himself alludes to the
cicada in terms of respect calling its shrill song “delicate music”
whilst hesiod tells of “the dark-winged tettix when he begins to sing
to men of the coming summer; he whose meat and drink is of the
refreshing dew and who all day long and at break of day pours forth his
voice”
there was no end apparently to the love of the ancients—especially the
greeks—for the cicadas or tettiges—for they were known by both names—or
to the graceful things they said of them from poets and philosophers
down to ploughmen all were equally fond of them “we bless thee
tettix” says a poet whose name has been merged in that of one who is
now a name only though a great one—anacreon namely—“we bless thee for
that seated on the tree-tops sipping the dew thou singest royally
oh sweetest of summer prophets! honoured by mortals thou art cherished
by the muses phœbus himself loves thee and gave thee thy shrill song”;
and plato tells us that “as music soothes the mind and dissipates
fatigue so the ploughman loves and cherishes the cicada for its song”
the greek ploughman apparently was a less gross embodiment than the
one of the present day after twenty-five centuries or so of
improvement to apollo the cicadas were sacred because they
“everlastingly sang to the sun”[] and for the muses they had once
supplied their place “as the story goes” says plato “before the muses
lived the cicadas were men on earth and so loved song and singing that
to lose no time from it they left off eating and so died of that dear
delight but in death they became cicadas and this boon was granted
them by the muses lately born that on earth they should eat no more
but only sing until they died again and that then they should return to
the muses to tell them who amongst mortals loved and worshipped them
most” “a lover of music like yourself” says socrates in the “phædrus”
of plato addressing one of _his_ worshippers “ought surely to have
heard this story of the cicadas how they were once human beings but
died through forgetting to eat but now dear to the muses they hunger
no more thirst no more but sing only from their birth and in heaven
they tell terpsichore of the dancers erato of the lovers calliope
eldest of the nine and urania of those whose heart is in
philosophy—and thus they whisper to them all”
so established were these and similar stories that in greece a cicada
perched on a harp was often engraved upon gems as the symbol of the
muses and were there a musical contest one had only to settle on the
lyre or pipe of the competitor it favoured for the prize to be
instantly adjudged to that one—since apollo was then held to have
spoken only in the absence of such indication were other methods of
forming a conclusion resorted to in common with other graceful
creatures cicadas were often kept as pets by the greeks and that
mausoleums were sometimes raised to these favourites we know from the
following epigram of the poetess anytie—written probably for the friend
it celebrates:—“for a grasshopper a nightingale of the fields and for
an oak-haunting cicada myro has built one common tomb there the maiden
sits and weeps for three pets torn from her by unrelenting hades”
amongst the athenians the cicadas were looked upon as children of the
soil of attica and those only who like them had been born upon it
were permitted to twist the golden tettix or bodkin amidst their
flowing locks thus forming the knot in which they were accustomed to
wear them this privileged bodkin received its name through being
surmounted with the head in gold of a cicada or tettix and the
wearers—or bearers—of these insignia—which were strictly forbidden to
strangers—were known for this reason as tettigophori they were most
proud of the distinction and indeed as it showed them to be
athenians they had a somewhat better right to be than is common in such
cases yet amidst all this praise we meet here and there with a
dissentient note hercules for instance feeling inclined to sleep
once on the banks of the river opposite where the town of locris
stood and not being able to on account of the perpetual singing of the
cicadas took it so seriously that he prayed to the gods to put a stop
to their disturbing him the gods with whom hercules was always a
favourite heard his prayer and cicadas from that time ceased to sing
opposite locris though they swarmed all round about that town here it
seems just to be hinted that hercules was not very fond of the cicadas’
song and virgil—but he was a roman—has called it (_infandum!_) a
_creaking_ note on the whole however when he mentions these insects
he gives us a pleasing picture
              “_sole sub ardenti resonant arbusta cicadis_”
he sings; a line which seems bathed in sunlight and makes one see the
green lizards too on the whole i cannot help thinking that virgil loved
the cicadas
it is interesting to find that in modern italy generally but
especially in tuscany the old ideas and legends in regard to the
cicadas have not yet died out still according to the tuscan peasant
they were maids—not men—before the muses till apollo as a mark of his
favour promoted them into insects now however but little distinction
seems to be drawn between cicadas and crickets or grasshoppers and
indeed this was to some extent the case in classical times—the three
often figuring together on ancient coins or rings amongst all of
these—and together they supply a number of species—the greatest
favourite with the tuscan peasant of to-day—as perhaps it was in days
long gone by—is a beautiful grey-green grasshopper which the americans
would call a katydid but is here the cavalletta this insect is
looked upon as the special patron of children upon whom it has the
power of conferring musical and poetic genius as well as more general
mental endowments to perform this properly however it must enter the
room where its little favourite lies asleep and this it seems often to
do the mother should she see it has her own part to play in the
matter which she does by tying the beneficent insect by a long thread
to the bed-post and chanting the following verses with the idea
probably that “then the charm is firm and good”
                  “cavalletta good and fair
                   you bring good fortune everywhere
                   then since into this house you’ve come
                   oh bring good fortune to our home
                   unto me and everyone
                   but bring it mostly to my son
                   cavalletta this i pray
                   bring and do not take away
                   in life you were a lady full
                   of talent good and beautiful
                   let me pray as this is true
                   you’ll give my child some talent too
                   and when you fly from east to west
                   may you in turn be truly blest
                   for though an insect form you bear
                   you’re still a spirit good and fair”
                               chapter x
    cicadas in england—a blower of bubbles—the prolific aphis—a
      nice calculation—scientific curiosity—dragon-fly armies—the
      son of the south-west wind
it is generally understood that there are no cicadas or tettixes in
england and this—with a reservation in favour of a single species
residing in the new forest—is roundly asserted in various entomological
works of authority since however mr george bowdler buckton frs
has written a monograph of the british _cicadæ_ or _tettigidæ_ in two
volumes each of which has a number of plates giving figures of the
various species all with their latin names there would seem to be a
conflict of learned opinion; and i for my part—since one of these
species has relations with a nice little parasite which i should like to
describe—am of opinion after profound investigation and impartial
weighing of the evidence on both sides that mr buckton is right what
strikes one at first sight as curious is that numbers of creatures as
large sometimes as humble bees or larger and of very striking
appearance—often quite brilliantly coloured—should for so long have
escaped observation; for certainly one has never seen them oneself and
on making inquiries one soon finds that nobody else has but there is
an explanation of this seeming miracle and that of a not very
satisfactory nature one may have noticed whilst going through the
plates that in the neighbourhood of each striking figure there are two
little irrelevant-looking black lines drawn soft and fine very
unobtrusive looking as though they wished to elude observation; and
gradually it begins to dawn upon you that these lines represent the real
size in linear measurement of the very salient _outré_-looking creature
you are looking at this then is the key to the mystery england is
full of cicadas but they are all so small that nobody can see them—at
least without taking some trouble so our poets have been silent our
philosophers have made no reflections and our ploughmen to this day
are without a proper objective for those appreciative perceptions of
life around them which if it only existed there might be some evidence
of their possessing our aristocracy too or old county families have
never been able to “think gold of themselves” as the saying is on
account of their golden tettix-pins though the feeling itself has not
been entirely denied them in a word our national character has been
uninfluenced by cicadas and on this two questions arise: first—for it
is no use to start on an assumption—whether faults exist in it and
then if they do whether all or any of them are due to this cause but
such matters are for the historian to deal with and would be out of
place in the pages of a work like this
though cicadas are so small in england—whilst their voices if they have
any as there seems no particular reason to doubt are too attenuated to
be audible to our human ears—yet they are not quite invisible when
seen however they are known by some other name such as frog-hoppers
tree-hoppers or the like some of these in their larval stage which
much resembles the adult take a great deal of pains to conceal
themselves though in this they have another reason than that of wishing
to elude observation our common cuckoo-spit is a good instance of this
and also of how a wrong explanation of a common and easily observed
phenomenon may for a long time be given not only in popular works but
also in scientific text-books or monographs or within the supposedly
up-to-date pages of various encyclopædias the cuckoo-spit as everyone
knows sits in the midst of a little bower of froth (allied to that
other of bliss perhaps) which on being examined resolves itself into
an accumulation of bubbles having a somewhat sticky consistency we had
always been told—and still are now very often though the contrary has
been well made out—that these bubbles proceeded from the insect itself
after the manner of any other secretion but this is not the case the
secretion here is only a clear fluid and into this the insect
afterwards blows bubbles by a mechanical process and through the
addition of air it is professor e s morse who in the pages of
_appleton’s popular scientific monthly_[] has thus revolutionised all
our ideas on this subject his account is as follows: “the so-called
frog-spittle or cuckoo-spit appears as little flecks of froth on grass
buttercups and many other plants during the early summer immersed in
this froth is found a little green insect sometimes two or three of
them concealed by the same moist covering this little creature
represents the early stage of an insect which in its full growth still
lives upon grass and is easily recognised by its triangular shape and
its ability of jumping like a grasshopper”
“if the insect is cleared from the mass of froth it will crawl quite
rapidly along the stem of the plant stopping at times to pierce the
stem for the purpose of sucking the juices within and finally settling
down in earnest clutching the stem with its legs after sucking for
some time a clear fluid is seen to exude from the end of the abdomen
flowing over the body first and gradually filling up the spaces between
the legs and the lower part of the body and the stem upon which it
rests during all this time not a trace of an air-bubble appears; simply
a clear slightly viscid fluid is exuded and this is the only matter
that escapes from the insect this state of partial immersion continues
for an hour or more during this time and even when walking the
posterior segments of the insect’s abdomen are extended at intervals
the abdomen turning upwards at the same time it is a kind of
reaching-up movement but whether this action accompanies a discharge of
fluid or is an attempt at reaching for air i have not ascertained
suddenly the insect begins to make bubbles by turning its tail out of
the fluid opening the posterior segment and grasping as with a pair
of claspers a moiety of air then turning the tail down into the fluid
again and instantly allowing the enclosed air to escape these
movements go on at the rate of seventy or eighty times a minute the
tail is moved alternately to the right and left in perfect rhythm so
that the bubbles are distributed on both sides of the body and these
are crowded towards the head till the entire fluid is filled with
bubbles and the froth thus made runs over the back and around the stem
in half a minute some thirty or forty bubbles are made in this way—a
bulk of air two or three times exceeding that of the body—without the
slightest diminution in the size of the body”
it seems clear therefore that the air which is put to this purpose is
abstracted directly from the atmosphere and that neither it nor the
bubbles manufactured through it have ever been within the body of the
insect moreover if the little bubble-maker be thoroughly dried—which
according to professor morse is a matter of difficulty—it will continue
to secrete such spare fluid as it still has but not the tiniest bubble
is seen to issue with this if set in a drop of water it struggles to
the surface and then goes through the same process of blowing bubbles
as it has done when immersed in fluid of its own distilling the result
however is not the same for the water will not hold the bubbles which
constantly disappear such then is the manner in which the frothy pool
is made what purposes does it answer that of a pond apparently for
it would appear that in their larval state these little frog- or
tree-hoppers are to some extent aquatic insects if kept dry and not
allowed to renew their supply of fluid their body shrivels and before
long they die this is not through suffocation since they can breathe
air by means of spiracles in the ordinary way if however they are
examined closely certain leaf-like appendages may be detected upon each
side of the seventh and eighth segments of the abdomen and professor
morse suggests that these may be of the nature of branchiæ or gills
enabling the insect to breathe also in water or fluid by abstracting
the air from it after the manner of a fish as some other aquatic larvæ
do “as many of these” he says “respire in two ways either inhaling
air through the spiracles or by means of branchial leaflets so
_aphrophora_ (for that is the classic name of our insect) may likewise
utilise its branchial tufts for the same purpose thus we may see the
reason for this bubble-blowing since each fresh bubble added to the
mass may aerate the fluid so to speak and thus secure at intervals a
fresh supply of oxygen”[]
in early spring if one examines the leaf-buds of rose trees which now
begin to swell one may often see tiny little black specks like grains
of gunpowder scattered over their surface especially within any fold
or crevice which it presents these are the eggs of the aphides insects
which if not cicadas are not so very far removed from them and which
looked at from various points of view are extremely interesting little
creatures one of these points of view which we may conveniently start
from is their extraordinary rate of increase which exceeds even that
of the chinese “a single insect” says mr buckton “hatched from one
of these shining black ova may be the mother of many billions of young
even during her lifetime réaumur calculated that one aphis may be the
mother of the enormous number of  individuals during the
month or six weeks of her existence but neither tongard nor morren is
satisfied with this estimate both declaring that quintillions are
within the capabilities of a single mother’s efforts professor huxley
(who by the way was not interested in the alleged phenomena of
spiritualism _even if true_) makes a curious calculation which at any
rate affords some approximate idea of what a quintillion of aphides
might mean assuming that an aphis weighs as little as one-thousandth of
a grain (which is less than i should ever have thought) and that it
requires a man to be very stout to weigh more than two million grains
he shows that the tenth brood of aphides alone without adding the
product of all the generations which precede the tenth if all the
members survive the perils to which they are exposed contains more
ponderable substance than  of stout men: that is more than
the whole population of china”[] this it appears is an
under-estimate which is rather annoying for one would like to call it
a gross exaggeration but facts are facts—in whatever degree they may
interest one—and it is impossible not to feel respect for an insect like
this especially in these days when the diminished returns of the
census are beginning to cause alarm as to the future destinies even of
our own once proudly fecund race it is a wonderful record for a single
individual—to have weighed down china—and when mr buckton remarks that
facts like these regarding the prolific nature of aphides “afford
sufficient explanation of the occurrence of the extraordinary swarms so
often noticed by authors”[] nobody is likely to disagree with him
with billions a certainty and quintillions in the air swarms seem
amply accounted for
one of the authors here alluded to is our homely immortal white of
selborne “i shall here mention” he says “an emigration of small
aphides which was observed in the village of selborne no longer ago
than august st  at about three o’clock in the afternoon of that
day which was very hot the people of this village were surprised by a
shower of aphides or smother-flies which fell in these parts those
that were walking in the streets at that juncture found themselves
covered with these insects which settled also on the hedges and
gardens blackening all the vegetables where they alighted my annuals
were discoloured with them and the stalks of a bed of onions were quite
coated over for six days after these armies were then no doubt in a
state of emigration and shifting their quarters; and might have come as
far as we know from the great hop-plantations of kent or sussex the
wind being all that day in the easterly quarter they were observed
at the same time in great clouds about farnham and all along the vale
from farnham to alton”[]
other great migrations of aphides have at various times been observed
in the autumn of  the city of gand was invaded and one may almost
say taken by a vast army of them and at bruges and antwerp the same
swarm is said to have darkened the sun[] a result of such gatherings
more noticeable elsewhere than in england since our sun usually is
darkened insects though their movements are not so regular nor as a
rule so noticeable as those of birds yet often migrate—how often or
how regularly it is difficult to say locusts are of course the stock
example as well as the most terrific one but perhaps dragon-flies were
they as destructive would have been as much noted in this connexion
their migrations seem to be tolerably frequent and a record of them
between  and  has been published by koppen a german
entomologist in  a great flight of them took place in illinois
“the air” we are told “for miles around seemed literally alive with
these dragon-flies from a foot above ground to as far as eye could
reach all flying in the same direction a south-westerly course and
the few that would occasionally cross the track of the majority could
all the more easily be noticed from the very regular and swift course
they generally pursued; but even these few stray ones would soon fall in
with the rest again very few were seen alighting and all carefully
avoided any movable obstacles”[] this migration took place during a
very dry season and may have been caused by it owing to the drying up
of swamps ponds etc in which the insects would otherwise have laid
their eggs obliging them to seek other suitable places
in the spring of  a great migration of dragon-flies was observed in
belgium “all the observers agree that the insects flew rather low with
astonishing regularity and without resting; that they kept close to the
earth where there were no obstacles but that they mounted to a height
of  to  mètres when houses or trees were in the way they did not go
round obstacles in their line of route but surmounted them and
descended on the other side according to some observers their flight
was very slow others again asserting that it was very swift when the
velocity could be estimated however it was found to be at  mètres per
second or  kilometres (¼ miles) per hour (so that the slows have
it) in general they went in groups more or less isolated and more or
less dense” the writer of the above account—a belgian—concludes thus:
“all the facts point to the following conclusions: the dragon-flies of
the th came from regions situated to the east of the country which
they entered in several columns flying at a great altitude: between 
and  am they descended towards the earth continuing their route
towards the west but we remain in ignorance of their point of
departure the swarm probably quitted its usual habitation early in the
morning and immediately flew to a great height it was only on arriving
near the earth that they flew against the wind”[] (which however
they then continued to do)
what mr hudson calls “dragon-fly storms” are a special phenomenon of
the pampas in this case the cause of the migration—for such movements
seem to come under this heading—is a special wind called the _pampero_
that blows south-west from the interior of the pampas it is very
violent cold and dry and the dragon-flies evidently fear it the
“storm” is thus described by mr hudson: “it is in summer and autumn
that the large dragon-flies appear; not _with_ the wind but—and this is
the most curious part of the matter—in advance of it; and inasmuch as
these insects are not seen in the country at other times and frequently
appear in seasons of prolonged drought when all the marshes and
watercourses for many hundreds of miles are dry they must of course
traverse immense distances flying before the wind at a speed of  or
 miles an hour on some occasions they appear almost simultaneously
with the wind going by like a flash and instantly disappearing from
sight you have scarcely time to see them before the wind strikes you
as a rule however they make their appearance from  to  minutes
before the wind strikes; and when they are in great numbers the air to
a height of  or  feet above the surface of the ground is all at
once seen to be full of them rushing past with extraordinary velocity
in a north-easterly direction in very oppressive weather and when the
swiftly advancing _pampero_ brings no moving mountains of mingled cloud
and dust and is consequently not expected the sudden apparition of
the dragon-fly is a most welcome one for then an immediate burst of
cold wind is confidently looked for in the expressive vernacular of the
gauchos the large dragon-fly is called ‘_hijo del pampero_’ son of the
south-west wind”[]

    aphides and their enemies—curious interrelations—the biter
      bit—altruistic development—bread and beer protectors—saved
      by ladybirds
with prolific powers which have been successful in arousing the interest
even of the late professor huxley it is a comfort to think that the
numbers of the aphides are always being kept down by the operation of
certain well-contrived causes most of which take the shape of various
insect enemies were all of these or perhaps were any one of them
entirely removed the whole world apparently might find itself deep
buried beneath a “star-y-pointing pyramid” of insect organisms for what
cannot quintillions in the hands of a competent mathematician achieve
the wonder certainly seems that any kind of check should be sufficient
we owe our safety in part as might have been surmised to a small
ichneumon fly the traces of whose work may generally be seen in a
number of brown lifeless corpses which are dotted about like so many
skeletons at the feast amongst any collection of living aphides these
if examined more closely are seen to be mere empty sacs each one
having at some part of it a quite circular aperture through which the
issuing guest has escaped but the amount of the good thus effected is
not to be estimated by the number of these shells these nests from
which the bird has flown such are only in the last stage of things
whilst almost all including the healthiest-looking of the living
aphides are probably travelling along the same road to arrive at the
same goal all or almost all have within them a guest whose energies
are unceasingly devoted to absorbing the whole of their interior
arrangements into itself and gradually taking their place “in june”
says mr buckton “during the hot weather i have seen at the same
time as many as three of these flies on one rose sprig each poised on
the back of an aphis which throws itself into many contortions for the
purpose of throwing off its enemy the ichneumon however remains fixed
on the back for ten or more minutes (as though enjoying the situation)
before the ovipositor is thrust under the skin of the victim and the egg
is laid the aphis appears to suffer at first but little since it soon
resumes its occupation of pumping up the sap a worm-like or more
commonly a maggot-like creature according to the species of the
parasite hatches from this egg which revels in the organised
nutritious fluid elaborated by the aphis the greater part of the
abdomen is occupied by this maggot when it becomes full fed and then it
may often be seen through the transparent integument as a grub curled
into a semicircle finally the aphis dies the grub ceases to feed and
after a certain period of rest cuts out of the roof of its prison a
circular plate like a trap-door as regular in form as if a carpenter’s
centre-bit had been used the emerging fly has four wings long antennæ
composed of numerous joints a wasp-like body and legs and is in every
way suited for its marauding expeditions”[]
other and more interesting dramas can take place within the body of an
aphis; wheels within wheels one masterpiece of economic contrivance
enclosing another perfection more perfected along what path indeed
can the beauty and wisdom of nature—those endless steps from endless
seeming halting-places that become when reached but so many points of
fresh departure—be run to earth so to speak the brain becomes at
last almost weary in the pursuit of wisdom’s ways and even the
delighted spirit would fain cry “hold! enough!” thoughts like these are
powerfully excited by the following picture
it is spring early spring and already the young aphides have begun
with gladness born of the opening year to absorb the sweet sap from the
stems of the immature wheat-crop later however when july’s sun shines
brightly behind its cooling screen of clouds—for in england all climatic
extremes are tempered—they ascend in “numbers numberless” to attack the
ear itself what then can save the hope of the husbandman what but
_ephedrus plagiator_ a small black-winged ichneumon fly that even now
is at work as each individual aphis clings to the wheat it becomes in
spite of its efforts to fill itself hollower and hollower; its appetite
flags and ere it can fatally affect the plant on which man’s life and
the machinations of the protectionist depend it has become a mere brown
pupa-case for a body other than its own to develop in a day or two and
almost on every grain of the wheat hangs an insect lifeless but—oh
floweret springing from the tomb!—life-filled hardly a living aphis is
to be seen feeding amongst them the wheat-crop has been saved but the
march of events thus unfolded does not end here another drama has to
be played out ere the full life issues from the once living cradle whose
contents it has absorbed and become nor will it bear the image of that
particular ichneumon fly that laid its little egg some weeks ago in
the body that seemed so designed for it like the aphis the ichneumon
too must learn to live for others thus rising through selfishness to a
purer and higher embodiment if we pass a little later through the same
cornfield another insect differing from yet of the same general type
as the prior parasite may be seen running to and fro over the
wheat-ears tapping each tenanted abode with tremulously quivering
antennæ which as well as the whole body seem to vibrate with
excitement it is looking for lodgings but not every house so touched
can be utilised for _ceraphrus carpenteri_—such is the new tenant’s
name—must first be satisfied that none of its own species have already
taken possession once assured on this point however its duty lies
plain before it and bending its antennæ against the wheat-ear so as to
form a fulcrum it turns the tip of its abdomen towards that of the dead
aphis and with its ovipositor commences to saw through the skin as
much as ten minutes may be occupied in the accomplishment of this task
for the sarcophagus that has thus to be pierced is hard and the
ovipositor though short is not stout but slenderly formed but there
is no flagging of energy and at length when efforts steadily continued
have been crowned with success the same deft instrument is again
employed to pierce the sleeping _ephedrus_ and a second egg is
deposited in this second cradle to this new tenant the former one must
now yield up the juices of its body even as those of the aphis were
freely rendered unto it it must die in its turn but by its death
another lives and thus the physical act of aggression which we call
selfishness becomes the seed-bed as it were or forcing-house—the
food-plant to use an entomological simile—of a moral altruism true
the aphis may at first struggle the maggot pierced by the ovipositor
may flinch for a moment but after that there is complete passivity
without which there can be no complete acquiescence self-absorption
that is the moral of it all; for the true self of the aphis which is
not represented by the outer husk is absorbed into the ichneumon and
so in regard to the latter thus throughout the animal kingdom we must
look to the inner and not to the outer significance what matters it
though nature be “red in tooth and claw” if the fierce rendings of the
outer integuments are but as the first gropings towards interior rest
and calm and should we not in the lower walks of life look to the
soul through the body and see in processes which with ourselves might
seem to represent the flesh only a blending which but anticipates the
more complete separation thus and thus only as it appears to me can
we impart beauty to a scheme which without this key must appear
selfish and unsatisfactory the key may be hard to find but when we
once hold it we need no longer repine
besides the wheat aphis which but for such arrangements as have here
been glanced at would almost deprive us of bread we have the hop
aphis a species the dread of which is still more strongly disseminated
amongst the masses of this country inasmuch as its interference would
be with the supply of beer no wonder then that the little ladybird is
beloved by all since but for its efforts many a poor man might have
to live in a state of enforced sobriety which in its turn must
deleteriously affect that position of respect and esteem which many
illustrious and highly placed individuals now hold in the hearts of the
people so that a general disturbal of habits and ideas amounting
almost to moral chaos would attend any serious diminution in the
numbers of this insect england’s true guardian angel but it were
unjust to claim an undue share in the merit of recognising work like
this appreciation of such services is as one might expect widely
spread and is expressed in such popular names as for instance in
lombardy “bestioline del signore” in tuscany “madonnine” or
“marioline” in france “bête” or “vache à dieu” and in germany
“sonnenkäfer” the first-named countries indeed are not or used not
to be beer-drinking so that unless this little madonna is a patroness
of the vine too they are not so easy to understand it may however be
incidentally mentioned that the ladybirds are good friends to the
orchards and destroy many thousands of apple- or plum-eating aphides
aphides in fact of some kind or other are what they have come into
the world to destroy it is their mission their epos
the following account of the habits of these beneficent creatures
principally in the above connection is given by mr buckton a profound
student of insect life-histories: “the food of coccinella (the ladybird)
consists almost exclusively of aphides their marvellous voracity is
shown equally in their larval and their winged condition the former
stage may be commonly seen throughout early summer as slaty-grey or
brown six-footed creatures covered with tufted tubercles and provided
with mandibles efficient both for holding and sucking out the juices of
their victims in some years the imagos (or grown insects) are
wonderfully numerous and when they take wing form vast swarms which
travel great distances in the year  such a cloud passed over a
large part of kent sussex and surrey” and their effect (of the same
genial nature as that of bacchus wandering through the earth) was soon
seen in the good hop crop of the following year “although the
coccinella is not restricted to the hop aphis for its food it
frequently follows its migrations and travels on the same winds whilst
feeding the aphis is held and manipulated by the jaws or palpi of the
coccinella and the devouring operation proceeds amidst the struggles of
the victims from the apex of the abdomen to the thorax which parts
together with the head and legs are finally rejected”[] this
process—which is by no means confined to insect life but extends
upwards from it even into the highly organised mammalia—does not seem to
be a pleasant one to witness for mr buckton remarks upon it: “we may
express some hope in sympathy with the aphis that the automatic theory
of animal life may here find some place and that reflex action may
explain the fact that under the microscope the mutilated remains of
the aphis without stomach and without internal organs have been seen
to walk away and live after the operation for a considerable time!
automatically the coccinella furbishes up its jaws and antennæ in
readiness for another meal from thirty to forty aphides may thus be
consumed in one hour”[]
automatically perhaps—that is to say between the lines—we may gather
mr buckton’s opinion of the automatic theory there are some theories
which seem held like dykes or barriers to prevent the sea from getting
in one doesn’t want the sea to get in because it would swamp such a
lot of things which although quite artificial one is not prepared to
part with but one doesn’t believe in the barrier except for that
particular purpose to which it is applied the automatic theory in
regard to animals is a case in point scientific men make use of it in
order to keep out another which they don’t want to have to admit
though they do as a fact believe in it this again one can read
between the lines whenever they give any account of their observations
on this or that animal whether it be dog or elephant ants or something
much lower down in the scale—rotifers for instance or amœba in the
ocean of a watch-glass one sees what they really mean very well then
though they may not themselves be aware of it but they are never in the
least _convincing_ when they air their automatic theory aphides as may
have been gathered incidentally feed wholly upon the juices or sap of
plants active _ab ovo_ (which means from the egg) “their occupation”
says mr buckton “is to grow as fast as possible” and with a view to
this end the rostrum or beak with its enclosed sucking or pumping
apparatus is fully developed from the very commencement “often
indeed to such an abnormal extent that it forms an awkward appendage
trailing behind the body whilst walking”[] the insect does not
however walk much but settling itself down on the twig or stem where
perhaps it first saw the light pierces the bark with the instrument
thus provided for it and commences to suck up the sap into its mouth
this is not a process which can be indulged in with impunity to the
plant especially since aphides reside in great societies upon the same
one and turn their attention to every part of it not even excepting
the roots troops of small aphides in fact have sometimes been found
in the pips of large codling apples in consequence of this excessive
drain upon their fluids which is as though our own blood were to be
sucked plants thus invaded by aphides become greatly weakened and
their young shoots and leaves have a distorted appearance in
consequence others either through this cause alone or in consequence
of some poison or acid injected by the aphis have gall-like excresences
produced upon them these have a hollow interior into which the aphides
penetrate and there take up their residence such swellings thus become
their houses and therefore since it is a great advantage to the
aphides to be sheltered in this way it is possible that some special
instinct through the exercise of which the tree is thus affected may
have been implanted in them by the action of natural selection
aphides are often spoken of by entomologists as if a very high degree of
interest attached to them and no doubt in many respects this is the
case as we have seen they exhibit certain phenomena of _corporealism_
(which _did_ interest professor huxley) to a greater extent perhaps than
any other creature though of this i am not at all sure; but after all
one soon gets over the wonder of that especially since there is no
realising it and then it does not seem to raise a creature to a very
high level of interest again to quote authority “there is a most
curious alternation of broods in these insects some forms being winged
and with separate sexes and others wingless or apterous and capable of
producing their kind for an indefinite number of generations before a
sexual brood is again developed in fact the anomalies of members of
this family are endless and it would require volumes to epitomise even
the comparatively little which has already been discovered with
reference to their habits and transformations”[] still for all this
it is difficult to look long at an aphis or a collection of aphides
upon a rose tree or any other of the plants they affect without getting
heartily tired of them and for me as perhaps for most people the
principal interest about these sluggish creatures lies in the relations
which have become established without any intelligent efforts on their
own part between them and ants—but it will be best to reserve the
discussion of this subject for the following chapter
                             chapter xii
    ants and their honey-cows—a mutual benefit—unity of motive—the
      end and the means—two ways of getting honey—insect
      cattle—wasps as cow-milkers—a cow-keeping bee—ant
      cow-sheds—aphides in ants’ nests—children of light and
      darkness—forethought extraordinary
a drop of honey or something like it is the connecting bond between
the ant and the aphis it is exuded by the latter through certain
tubercles which are situated at the end of the abdomen and is of
course the product of the endless quantities of sap which so long as
it lasts these insects are for ever pumping up from the plant they
inhabit and swallowing this honey or honey-dew to use the more
special name bestowed on it the ants want but they are not content
with drinking it whenever it issues from its manufacturers in natural
course this is not sufficient and they have learned to increase the
flow of so valued a beverage by their own efforts—in other words they
milk the aphides which thus become their cows to do this they tap them
with their antennæ softly and gently on the sides of the abdomen—a
quick little shower of touches under the influence of this probably
pleasant sensation the aphis becomes willing to part and raising the
abdomen “teems her refreshing dew” in a drop from the tip of it this
action of the ants cannot in europe be successfully imitated at least
it has not been and if an ant is not forthcoming the fluid is contained
in the body of the aphis until necessity compels its being ejected
probably the ants if delayed in their visits are missed by the
aphides as a cow misses her milker and long before they do excrete as
the process is called they would perhaps have done so had they felt
able the sensation no doubt of the ant’s antennæ on the abdomen has
become through usage the almost necessary stimulus to the act produced
by it
the above remarks are best illustrated by a quotation from darwin
which in my opinion should always be given in any general account of
the relations of ants and aphides “i removed” says darwin “all the
ants from a group of about a dozen aphides on a dock plant and
prevented their attendance during several hours after this interval i
felt sure that the aphides would want to excrete i watched them for
some time through a lens but not one excreted i then tickled and
stroked them with a hair in the same manner as well as i could as the
ants do with their antennæ; but not one excreted afterwards i allowed
an ant to visit them and it immediately seemed by its eager way of
running about to be well aware what a rich flock it had discovered; it
then began to play with its antennæ on the abdomen first of one aphis
and then of another; and each as soon as it felt the antennæ lifted up
its abdomen and excreted a limpid drop of sweet juice which was eagerly
devoured by the ant even the quite young aphides behaved in this
manner showing that the action was instinctive and not the result of
experience it is certain from the observations of huber that the
aphides show no dislike to the ants: if the latter be not present they
are at last compelled to eject their excretion but as the excretion is
extremely viscid it is no doubt a convenience to the aphides to have it
removed; therefore probably they do not excrete solely for the good of
the ants”[]
if the reverse of this were the case if the aphides did excrete for the
sole benefit of the ants then in darwin’s own opinion the case for
natural selection would be broken down and with this there would be
some better ground of reason for those who would see in relations of
this sort a set-off as it were against the never-ending bloodshed and
rapine accompanied with suffering in varied—often in an intense—degree
which is the very stuff out of which nature has woven her mantle but
there can be no essential difference where the principle at work is
precisely the same so long as a creature does benefit itself the way
in which it does it and the incidental effects of its doing so are of
no consequence; it is the motive power that the philosopher has to
consider and there is little comfort—if comfort be needed—in knowing
that an animal to do itself good is doing good to some other when one
also knows that governed by the same incentive it would as cheerfully
prey upon that other’s eye as hamlet says in such a case “the
readiness is all”
as an illustration of this truth here is another picture of how ants
procure honey from a weaker creature that may happen to have swallowed
it when it is not to be obtained by the soft methods of persuasion
“once upon a time” says dr lincecum “there dwelt in my yard a
flourishing colony of the very smallest species of black ant” and
having described how these lilliputians found and ate some syrup
belonging to the household and were in consequence attacked by a larger
and stronger species he continues “they”—that is the attacking
party—“grabbed up the heavily burdened little fellows doubled them and
biting open the abdomen drew out the full sac and seemed to swallow
it then casting the lacerated carcase aside they furiously sprung
upon another of the panic-stricken crowd and repeated the horrid
operation”[] clearly then nature so long as she can attain her
end cares not by what means she attains it
independently of any feeling of comfort which the aphides may experience
in being milked by the ants observation at once shows that they benefit
largely in a general way by the attentions of the latter it is not
enough for the ants to milk their cows when they happen to meet them
they go very much farther than this and cow-keeping is of as much
importance with them as with us lucky the aphis who has a guard of ants
round it fiery warriors prepared to defend their property against all
foes none need be feared now let but an ichneumon buzz and a dozen
stalwarts start to the rescue
          “i dare thee but to breathe upon my love”
          “fear not sweet wench they shall not touch thee kate
           i’ll buckler thee against a million”
and so they do indeed or against any reasonable number but there is no
combination amongst these banditti each comes but to eat his own aphis
and no one thinks of helping a friend all therefore are powerless
before the organised attack of so fierce a bodyguard whilst the ants
are with them the aphides are quite safe and they are often permanently
guarded in this way other ants take even more elaborate precautions for
the safety of their property placing them in stalls where they stand
by plastering earth etc about the plant on which they are feeding
lastly others still conduct them into their own nest where they keep
them sometimes in a chamber specially prepared for their reception
every necessary measure being taken for their proper nourishment and
as one may say comfort nay the very eggs of the aphides are tended by
the ants and hatch out in their own nurseries nor is it little for
which they do all this since taking their size into consideration the
yield of these ant-cows each day must be much greater than that of our
own—at least i should imagine so
it is not all ants who do these things nor do any do all of them but
where there are aphides and also ants it would seem to be the exception
rather than the rule for the latter to neglect them
but aphides though the principal ant-cows of europe are not the only
ones even there whilst elsewhere various other species that have this
honey-excreting property become their substitutes “in the tropics”
says belt in his much-observing work “their place is taken in a great
measure by species of _coccidæ_ and genera of _homoptera_ such as
_membracis_ and its allies my pineapples were greatly subject to the
attacks of a small soft-bodied brown coccus that was always guarded
by a little black stinging ant (_solenopsis_) this ant took great care
of the scale-insects and attacked savagely any one interfering with
them as i often found to my cost when trying to clear my pines by being
stung severely by them not content with watching over their cattle the
ants brought up grains of damp earth and built domed galleries over
them in which under the vigilant guard of their savage little
attendants the scale insects must i think have been secure from the
attacks of all enemies”[] and again the same naturalist tells us
“the pawpaw trees growing in my garden were infested by a small brown
species of _membracis_—one of the leaf-hoppers that laid its eggs in a
cottony nest on the under part of the leaves the hopper would stand
covering the nest until the young were hatched these were little
soft-bodied dark-coloured insects looking like aphides but more
robust and with the hind segments turned up from the end of these the
little larvæ exuded drops of honey and were assiduously attended by
small ants belonging to two species of the genus _pheidole_ a third
ant—a species of _hypoclinea_—which i have mentioned before as a
cowardly species whenever it found any young hoppers unattended would
relieve them of their honey but would scamper away on the approach of
any of the _pheidole_ the latter do not sting but they attack and bite
the hand if the young hoppers are interfered with”[] the latter “are
when young so soft-bodied and sluggish in their movements and there
are so many enemies ready to prey upon them that i imagine that in the
tropics many species would be exterminated if it were not for the
protection of the ants”[]
but these leaf-hoppers had not only ants but wasps to protect them and
there were constant skirmishes and bickerings on their account between
the two the wasp obtained the honey just in the same way as the
ants—namely by stroking the hoppers with its antennæ and its
possession of wings more than its greater size gave it a clear
advantage over its rival it did not grapple with the latter even when
there was only a single one to dispute its right but rising on the
wing and hovering about till a good opportunity presented itself it
would dart down suddenly on the impertinent little dwarf and strike it
from the leaf or stem so quick was this action that mr belt could not
determine whether it was with the feet or the mandibles that the wasp
delivered its blow but he thinks it was with the former; that is to
say the front pair of them but in spite of its superiority in single
combat the wasp could not prevail against the numbers of the ants if
indeed it was first in the field there was not much difficulty for
though the leaf would before long be found by some or other of the ants
yet the first arrivals were only pioneers and when once they were
knocked off it it had to be found again only for a similar fate to
befall the new discoverers often however the wasp would try to clear
a leaf already in possession of the ants and the way to which was
known but in this it was never successful for though many fell
streams of others came rushing up so that the wasp had no time to enjoy
the fruits of its labours but was obliged to keep constantly fighting
and before long was tired out though a giant amongst pigmies and
having wings—a sort of flying-dragon contending with an army of
knights—yet it did not despise its small enemies and evidently dreaded
lest any of them should succeed in fastening on it no doubt it
knew—from inheritance or experience or both—that an ant clinging to a
leg was a difficult thing to get rid of and to avoid being placed in
this position it never fought upon the ground—that is the leaf—but only
on the wing in the manner described had it used its mandibles to bite
with the ants would have seized them and some might have got on its
body its sting played no part doubtless because the small size and
hard bodies of the ants would have rendered it ineffective
we see from the above account that ants are not the only insects that
can make discreet use of honey-yielding creatures though they excel all
others in this respect wasps have also learnt to milk if not to stall
their kine and to wasps it would seem must be added—which need not
surprise us—at least one species of bee a correspondent whose name and
date of communication i cannot now remember says writing to _nature_:
“fritz muller has observed in brazil a larva of a leaf-hopper—_umbonia
indicator_—which is used like the aphides by the ants as milch cattle
by a species of stingless bee—_trigonia cagafogo_ this bee is fond of
oily matters and feeds on carrion old stinking cheese and oil
secreted by various plants although stingless it possesses a very
intense venom which causes a most lively irritation of the skin” i
wish i could give the details of a fact so interesting but have not had
the opportunity of reading the original account from which this bald
statement is taken the ants therefore have rivals in this industry
and possibly such rivalry may exist to an extent hitherto unsuspected
though the protection of these insects by the ants architecturally—by
moist earth placed round them that is to say—is mentioned in the above
account it is not dwelt upon and seems to play but a small part in the
general drama some ants however rely solely on this method mr
gaudie writing in the _victorian naturalist_[] gives the following
account of one of these: “a small species of ant commonly distributed
in the mallee has a curious habit of keeping in close confinement a
rather large mealy aphis which feeds on the stems of young eucalyptus
gum trees round and over these aphides the ants construct a domed
covering of particles of bark grass etc which serves the double
purpose of imprisoning the aphides and excluding other ants some of
these coverings appear to be entirely closed whilst others have an
opening left in the edges this doorway is however constantly guarded
by a pair of ants which continually move about in the open space and
seem much impressed with the importance of the duty assigned to them
each enclosure contains generally from three to a dozen aphides and
about the same number of ants upon making a breach in some of these
structures for the purpose of observation i have noticed that many of
the live stock were immediately seized by the ants and forcibly removed
to a place of safety the ant under notice is about a quarter of an inch
in length and is of a uniform dark reddish-brown colour and forms its
ordinary habitation under logs or in old rotten stumps and sometimes
in the ground several other species of ants are very assiduous in their
attendance on the various aphides _tettigonidæ_ and coccids but the
above is the only kind i have noticed that uses such extraordinary means
to secure a monopoly of the much-prized ‘honey-dew’”
for ants that keep and rear aphides in their nests we need not go
farther than our own little yellow one—_lasius flavus_ they guard and
look after the eggs of their protégés which form little black shiny
clusters with the same care that they bestow on their own and when
they are hatched set about providing food for the young aphides this
it would appear does not consist of the roots of various plants
penetrating the nest itself for sir john lubbock found that the first
business of the ants after the young aphides had appeared was to
conduct or carry them out of the nest evidently in order that they
should find their natural food none being at hand under these
artificial conditions and the plants required not being known the poor
aphides all died and this happened again the following year in the
year succeeding to this however sir john was more fortunate and this
is the account he gives of his interesting discovery: “the eggs
commenced to hatch the first week in march near one of my nests of
_lasius flavus_ in which i had placed some of the eggs in question was
a glass containing living specimens of several species of plants
commonly found on or around ants’ nests to this some of the aphides
were brought by the ants shortly afterwards i observed on a plant of
daisy in the axils of the leaves some small aphides very much
resembling those from my nest though we had not actually traced them
continuously they seemed thriving and remained stationary on the
daisy moreover whether they had sprung from the black eggs or not the
ants evidently valued them for they built up a wall of earth round and
over them so things remained throughout the summer but on the th of
october i found that the aphides had laid some eggs exactly resembling
those found in the ants’ nests; and on examining daisy-plants from
outside i found on many of them similar aphides and more or less of the
same eggs”[]
as the young aphides had been brought by the ants to the daisies and as
they had subsequently laid their eggs there it would certainly seem
that the ants are accustomed to collect these eggs from without and
that the aphides do not lay them in the nest when they are hatched the
young aphides as we have seen are taken out to feed and lay and these
new eggs laid by them are in their turn brought in and tended by the
ants this as sir john lubbock remarks is a much more remarkable thing
than if the aphides living in the nest with the ants simply laid their
eggs there in that case they would probably hatch out whether they were
tended or not and it could not be long before the ants would become
aware of their value here however we see this knowledge—how first
obtained we know not—exhibited in a more striking manner and also a
great degree of foresight displayed since as the eggs except for
accidents would hatch where they were it can only be with the idea of
providing against these that the ants bring them into their nest there
they are safe from many dangers which threaten them above ground and
are not exposed to the rigours of winter or other climatic vicissitudes
what are we to say of this act i think there might be one or two things
to say but sir john lubbock says this: “our ants may not perhaps lay
up food for the winter; but they do more for they keep during six
months the eggs which will enable them to procure food during the
following summer—a case of prudence unexampled in the animal
kingdom”[] there is a slight national note here which should
perhaps make us suspicious at least i am always suspicious when a
frenchman praises anything french an englishman anything english—even
ants or the climate—a tierra del fuegian anything in tierra del fuego
and so on no doubt if prudence really induces the act it is very
great but if we could imagine any other cause through which the habit
might have begun natural selection would have brought about the rest
since those ants which stored aphides’ eggs would have had more aphides
and consequently more honey-dew to nourish them than those which did
not now the eggs might at first have been eaten and so carried down
as provisions or aphides brought into the nest might have laid before
they got out again however the act originated it is probably a
prudential one now but if the growth of prudence has been aided by that
of an inherited habit having nothing to do with this it is not quite
so remarkable but what exactly does “our” in the above passage mean
_lasius flavus_ is not confined to england—at least i suppose not—and
if other countries have a claim on its mental powers our cue should
rather be to undervalue them—at least the note of national vanity
should be held in check by the all as powerful one of national
prejudice
besides these particular aphides which leave the nest directly after
leaving the egg there are four or five other species which live in it
altogether and feed on the roots of various growing plants some nests
which i had contained a few but under natural conditions they are to be
found i believe in abundance special chambers it would seem are
given up to them and in kirby’s _marvels of ant life_ there is a
picture of such a “subterranean cow-house” the question arises where
do these aphides lay their eggs and if in the nest does not it
largely discount the intelligence or prudence attributed to _lasius
flavus_ in bringing the other ones into it in that case since the eggs
of the various species probably resemble one another any found outside
would be brought in by the ants just as their own larvæ or pupæ would
be—or anything else which they value—nor need we ascribe greater
foresight to the one act than to the other
ants however do more wonderful things in relation to aphides than this
that sir john lubbock has recorded and if that act is unexampled as an
exhibition of prudence elsewhere in the animal kingdom it is not i
think in this particular branch of it first it must be remarked that
amongst the aphides we have what is called the “alternation of
generations” that is to say a light-loving generation that feeds on the
stems and leaves of upper earth produces one that loves darkness whose
food is only the underground roots of the plants their parents lived on
this brood in its turn gives birth to another which forthwith seeks the
sun and so the round goes on there is this difference in the two
broods that the light-lovers nevertheless seek out darkness when the
time comes to lay their eggs whilst the children of darkness lay theirs
in the caves where they have all their lives lived that ants should
be aware of all this and habitually adapt their cow-keeping economy to
circumstances so recondite seems very extraordinary but it would
certainly appear to be the case thus when _lasius fuliginosus_ (another
franco-britannico etc species) sees _schizoneura venusta_—its
particular aphis—seated on a grass stem and evidently wishing to lay
her eggs it knows at once what to do soft and large with voluminous
wings such an insect is not well fitted for burrowing she could hardly
do it in fact so the ants recognising this begin to do it for her
and soon drive a tunnel leading down to the roots of the grass through
which they lead her first however having clipped off her wings which
are now but a useless encumbrance
arrived at the terminus the ants make a proper apartment for their cow
aphis and here in the midst of warm sympathisers and with every
comfort and luxury about her she no longer hesitates to lay her eggs
in due time they hatch producing wingless aphides and from the brood
thus raised the ants obtain their honey when however this crawling
generation have in turn produced another winged one the ants far from
seeking to detain these in a place where they would only die again set
to work to make tunnels through which they conduct them successively to
the upper air one tunnel one would think would be sufficient for the
purpose; but lichtenstein who observed these facts in the south of
france[] states that each aphis as it issues from the egg has a
separate one made for it by the ants having reached the surface these
cave-born ariels spread their wings and fly away where they will settle
no ant knows but to the community that has freed them they are lost
probably—they and their eggs—for ever do the ants know this if they
do they do not repine at it for they know also that the perpetuation
of the species through which alone they can hope for fresh honey has
been provided for this seems to me altogether to outdo the prudential
feat of _lasius flavus_ and since _lasius fuliginosus_ is distributed
probably throughout the greater part of europe all the nations that do
honour to that portion of the earth’s surface are at equal liberty to
think of it with patriotic complacency as “_our_ ant” for my part i
will only say this that whether it is or not i think it deserves to
be a japanese ant—or that the japanese nowadays much more deserve to
have it than we do: that perhaps is the better way of putting it
                              chapter xiii
    cow caterpillars—the adventures of theophrastus—cave-born
      ariels—led to the sky—a strange attraction—ant slaves and
      slave-holders—slave-making raids—feeble masters—an ant
      mystery—effects of slavery—the decadent’s reply
as we have seen both in this chapter and a former one aphides are not
the only insects which yield the ants honey—or something honey-sweet—and
are cherished by them in consequence there are for instance the
coccidæ or scale insects as mentioned by belt; but whilst some of this
family are milked in the same way as the aphides to which indeed they
bear a strong resemblance others are simply eaten as though they were
sweets to them might be said in warning “make yourself all honey and
the _ants_ will swallow you” but who can modify the nature of his own
juices then there are the ants’-nest beetles many of which have a
sweet downiness which the ants enjoy licking and are for this reason
carried about with them when they move from one place to another not
that they are always carried for one little beetle at any rate whose
name—it must be a diminutive—is _formicoxenus nitidulus_ is accustomed
to ride on the backs of its protectors like the little cockroaches
discovered by professor wheeler
but perhaps the most interesting parallel to the aphides as cows is to
be found in certain caterpillars which are as soft and defenceless as
they are and represent a class of creatures which ants habitually prey
upon a certain family of butterflies however commonly known as the
blues but entitled to the scholarly name of _lycænidæ_ produce
caterpillars which bear upon the twelfth segment of the body a certain
honey-holding reservoir which when full or nearly so may be made to
yield its contents through the same treatment which is so effectual in
the case of the aphides the ants tap or titillate the body of the
caterpillar near where the gland is situated with their antennæ and
the caterpillars charmed with such affability overflow in return this
interesting fact has been observed in various parts of the old world
and also in north america; but the most detailed account which we have
of it comes from india in this case as in all the others the
caterpillar is a quite small one and feeds on the leaves of a certain
tree bearing both “an astringent yellow fruit” and the name of
_zizyphus jujuba_ though by the way jujubes are not as a rule
astringent the name of this little caterpillar—it would scorn to be
behind the tree it feeds on in such a matter—is _tarucus theophrastus_
so now we have something to fix it in the memory the ant that
patronises it is a large black one—_its_ name i cannot give—and here
too as in the case of the aphidean relations we have in the most
noteworthy of the actions recorded a very remarkable instance of what
looks like foresight and foresight too of a very large and general
kind in the first place the ants make a nest at the foot of the trees
in which the caterpillars reside and here during the period of their
growth and nourishment they avail themselves of their services but
when this period is over and the caterpillars are about to change into
chrysalids then a strange scene takes place all over the tree ants
are now to be seen running about in a state of the greatest excitement
and whenever they meet a caterpillar descending or preparing to
descend the trunk in order to burrow into the earth at its base and
there pass its pupal stage of existence they conduct it down themselves
and relieve it from the labour of digging just in the same way as our
english ants do with the aphides
still stranger is the scene which reveals itself if the earth at the
base of the tree be removed for then it is seen that chrysalids and
caterpillars that are about to turn into chrysalids are clinging all
round the trunk whilst all amongst them are the ants helping to place
this one or that one in position the band thus formed round the tree
may be several inches broad and it is always remarkably even as though
arranged on æsthetic principles as the light shines in the ants become
agitated and seizing hold of their property—for in this light they
consider the caterpillars—begin to rebury them so that in time if the
annoyance continues they will form a fresh circle of bodies lower down
the tree here then is an ants’ nest described as temporary by mrs
wyllie from whose interesting account[] the above facts are taken
full of butterfly chrysalids and in about a week it becomes full of
butterflies themselves and amidst the rough black bodies of hosts of
earth-working calibans colours born of the rainbow gleam and flash from
the fairy wings of delicate insect ariels each one of these was helped
from its cradle thus strangely situated by a little group of these
gnomes who then assisted it to unfold its wings and guided its
uncertain steps later when strength has come to it and something—it
knows not what—like an upward desire these same gnomes will lead it to
the portals of their gloomy hades where it will spread its wings and
fly to meet the light in so strange a way led by such uncouth guides
does ariel find the sky yet as though the place of their new
birth—gloomy though it be and opposed to their light-loving natures—had
yet some nameless attraction for them crowds of these butterflies may
be seen for some time after their exodus hovering over the nest
before they leave it for ever to dwell in the courts of the sun
just as in the case of the aphides released by _lasius fuliginosus_
these ants will never see their butterflies again nor will they gain
any after advantage that can with certainty be traced to the particular
individuals thus set free but they gain in such a manner as if the
reflection really occurred to them would make ants not much below men
the process of reasoning would be this: “though we may very likely not
get any caterpillars from the eggs which these butterflies will lay yet
we ought not to kill them because then there would be so many
butterflies less in the world to lay eggs and if we did this every
year and other ants too caterpillars as well as butterflies would
become scarce and at last we should not get enough” for myself i doubt
if ants really do reason like this but by what steps this habit of
releasing butterflies so as to ensure the perpetuation of the species
has come about i don’t quite see in the case of the aphides perhaps
it has been through actual observation of their habits and here too
this hypothesis may not be excluded since the butterflies might well be
seen laying their eggs nor is it unlikely that these are watched and
the issuing caterpillars tended from the beginning for the purposes of
the ants indeed all aphides and every theophrastus would be the
same and they might very well think that those which they found laying
or about to lay their eggs were the very ones previously liberated by
them from the nest thus the difficulty involved in supposing that they
must reason in a general and not merely in a particular way does not
really exist
some of these black caterpillar-tending ants of india are not always so
lucky as to secure stock they may live far from a _jujube_ tree and so
never meet the right species; but if ever they do even though it be in
the most unexpected manner they are not taken by surprise
notwithstanding that other caterpillars are habitually devoured by them
mrs wyllie proved this by an experiment “i took theophrastus” she
tells us “from a tree and introduced him on the pathway of another
company of the same species of ant which lived in our verandah but
kept no farm and it was odd to see the ants come tumbling out headlong
to fight the intruder and the sudden way in which they cooled down on
investigation of the foe none attempted to harm him and he was
politely escorted across the boundary the ants running alongside and
feeling him all over with their antennæ this must have been
instinctive as they could have had no former knowledge of him as a
‘milk-giver’” mrs wyllie adds that “the dead chrysalids in an ants’
nest are carefully removed and thrown away outside; the ants also
distinguish between the dead and the living”
anyone observing or reading about ants might exclaim on finding that
they utilised the natural product of other insects and kept them in
captivity in order to do so “where will this end may they not then
also keep slaves” and in very fact as all the world now knows we do
find what is called slavery amongst ants though to me it hardly seems
the right word since there is perfect willingness on the part of the
slave and no power of punishment lies with the master there is
equality moreover since this is not a matter of the kind of things
which one class of a community does and another does not do but of the
spirit in which each does them with the ants we have the japanese
spirit—or rather the japanese seem getting nearer to the ants—and so
there is real equality however the first act which makes these
creatures slaves—for i will use terms as i find them—is one of violent
and deadly hostility and through it they are of set purpose taken
possession of and carried off to the nest at that period however they
are yet in the cradle have yet to be born into their last and most
perfect state of life from the moment they are so born they grow up as
a part and indeed the most important part of the body politic and of
such pleasure and consideration as obtains in ant-life they have their
full share
from the above it may be gathered that these ant-slaves are ants
themselves and this indeed is the case one species of ant raids the
nest of another overpowers the able-bodied inhabitants slays or
incapacitates a certain number and carries away with it to its own nest
as many of the helpless pupæ as it is able to for a great many
years—thousands probably—these combats and carrying off of spoil had
been observed but it had always been imagined that the pupæ—or ants’
eggs as they are commonly called—were taken as provisions merely to be
stored in the nest of the victor and there eaten at leisure the
discovery of the real truth was an era in the study of ant-history and
it was made by a frenchman—pierre huber—a man of whom darwin says that
he was a “better observer even than his celebrated father” for pierre
was the son of françois huber the blind man who yet found out all
about bees i hardly see how he can have been _better_ myself; but the
son was not blind and of course eyesight is an advantage in
observation
the particular species of ant concerning which this discovery was made
is _formica rufescens_ or _polyergus rufescens_—the reader may take his
choice—and darwin who impresses the facts of ant-slavery upon the mind
better than a dozen books specially devoted to ants or insects says of
it: “this ant is absolutely dependent on its slaves and without their
aid the species would certainly become extinct in a single year the
males and fertile females do no work of any kind and the workers or
sterile females though most energetic and courageous in capturing
slaves do no other work they are incapable of making their own nests
or of feeding their own larvæ when the old nest is found inconvenient
and they have to migrate it is the slaves which determine the
migration and actually carry their masters (one might just as well call
_them their_ slaves) in their jaws so utterly helpless are the masters
that when huber shut up thirty of them without a slave but with plenty
of the food which they like best and with their own larvæ and pupæ to
stimulate them to work they did nothing; they could not even feed
themselves and many perished of hunger huber then introduced a single
slave and she instantly set to work fed and saved the survivors made
some cells and tended the larvæ and put all to rights what can be
more extraordinary than these well-ascertained facts”[] the slave-ant
in this case is _formica fusca_ and it is also held in bondage by
another species of slave-maker viz _formica sanguinea_—or the
blood-red ant—as was likewise a discovery of pierre huber this last
species is found in the south of england and its slave-making habits
have been observed by darwin who opened fourteen nests and found a few
slaves in all of them “the slaves” he tells us “are black and not
above half the size of their red masters so that the contrast in their
appearance is great”[] the black ants were not often seen by darwin
to leave the nest and others who have observed their habits in england
have considered them as “strictly household slaves”[] huber however
whose observations were carried on in switzerland says that “their
chief office is to search for aphides”[] and this would take them far
afield in switzerland however slaves seem to be more numerous in the
nests of the blood-red ant and darwin attributes the difference in
their habits to this account huber also tells us that the swiss slaves
“habitually work with their masters in making the nest and they alone
open and close the doors in the morning and evening”[] this is done
i suppose by placing pellets of earth in the mouth of the
entrance-tunnel and removing them again; but there is one species of ant
which would have only to place or remove itself for this purpose since
its large head by being wedged into the passage stops it up and thus
fulfils the office of a front door the ant that does this must be one
belonging to a certain caste of workers having very large heads for the
heads of the other ones would not be large enough the nest of this
species is made in decaying wood and there is always some worker who
thus uses his large head as a stopper removing it when a
fellow-townsman wishes to enter the nest but presenting its smooth
impenetrable surface guarded with jaws to all unauthorised intruders
it is forel one of the best ant-observers of to-day who tells us this
and the ant apparently is _lasius fuliginosus_ which is a british
species and according to an account which i have already referred to
does not seem to be always a wood-borer _formica sanguinea_ however
does things—or has things done for it—after a more ordinary fashion
darwin was the witness of a slave-raid on the part of _f sanguinea_
which was not in this instance very successful he says: “they
approached and were vigorously repulsed by an independent community of
the slave-species (_f fusca_) sometimes as many as three of these ants
clinging to the legs of the slave-making _sanguinea_ the latter
ruthlessly killed their small opponents and carried their dead bodies
as food to their nest twenty-nine yards distant; but they were
prevented from getting any pupæ to rear as slaves i then dug up a small
parcel of the pupæ of _formica fusca_ from another nest and put them
down on a bare spot near the place of combat; they were eagerly seized
and carried off by the tyrants who perhaps fancied that after all
they had been victorious in their late combat”[] in his work _ants
and their ways_[] the rev farren white describes a similar raid
which was—or rather which had been for it was nearly over when he
arrived on the scene—wholly successful here however the oppressed
species seems to have made a very poor resistance though very likely it
had been more vigorous in the earlier stages of the raid “i watched a
_fusca_” says mr white “carrying off a pupa from behind the entrance
whence the _sanguineæ_ were issuing forth immediately it saw one of the
enemy approaching it dropped its charge and left it to its fate the
_sanguinea_ then gave it a push and drove it off in double-quick time”;
and again “i noticed a _sanguinea_ coming up out of the nest with a
pupa and a _fusca_ observing it went up a fern-frond with the utmost
expedition”[] other observations of a similar nature were made and
the conclusion arrived at by mr white is “that between the _fuscæ_ and
the _sanguineæ_ there is a well-defined and clearly pronounced
antagonism in presence of the _sanguineæ_ the _fuscæ_ were
terror-stricken in fact the depredators had it all their own way and
were able in this instance at least to carry out their marvellous
instincts without destroying a single life”[] it will be seen how ill
this accords with the account given by darwin my own way of accounting
for the discrepancy is that in the first instance the little _fuscæ_
were flushed with success and in the second demoralised through
defeat the same effects would follow the same causes in all but the
most splendid human armies
the raids made by the first-mentioned species _polyergus rufescens_
or as huber calls them the amazon ants are of an even more determined
description for none are braver or perhaps so brave if one of these
should find herself alone and in the midst of enemies she makes no
effort to escape as many though not all other species would but
fights on to the end making constant agile leaps to this side or that
at every one of which she transfixes an enemy and dies at last biting
hard to fight indeed is the whole end aim and business of life for
an amazon and we have already seen how they do no work and are washed
fed and carried by their servants it is not quite true however that
they cannot feed themselves as pierre huber thought and had good
reason to think for a well-known living observer—herr wasmann—has
discovered that their mandibles are so constructed as to enable them “to
absorb nourishment from eggs or pupæ” possibly the mandibles are
hollow and communicate thus with the mouth as is the case with some
other insects but i have not wasmann’s account at hand and his
exponent says only this wasmann tells us also that these amazons will
“absorb nourishment” however they do it even from the eggs of their
own species they cannot however feed on liquid food and as they had
no other when shut up without servants that is why they died or would
have died had these not been brought them in time so too though their
slaves wash and brush them yet they are always brushing themselves and
attending generally to their own toilette and this they do even amidst
                    “all the currents of a heady fight”
so that wasmann has compared them to the spartans combing their long
hair before the battle of thermopylæ though we are not told that they
combed it after the fight had begun
still it seems plain that the habit of keeping slaves has exercised a
degrading influence on these ants and this tendency is much more
markedly apparent in several other species one of these with a really
dreadful name _strongylognathus_—we might call them strong ants but
they seem to be weak ones—is described by forel as “_une triste
caricature_” of the amazons and the extraordinary thing is that
though themselves feeble and enervated they manage to make or by
some means obtain as slaves the workers of a much more robust
species—_tetramorium_ to wit; workers by the way are the only class
of ants ever enslaved these weak ants fight in the same way as the
amazons themselves; but though spirited enough they are so much
inferior in bodily vigour to the _tetramoriums_ “a courageous species
living in large communities that in a battle between the two
artificially instigated by forel almost all the slave-holders were
killed without being able to avenge their deaths even on a single one
of those whom they aspired to rule” yet they won the day or rather
the already enslaved _tetramoriums_ who marched to do battle for
them won it for the few survivors in their ranks from this we can
see how when these decadents once have slaves they may get more the
difficulty is how they are obtained in the first instance—when a nest
is first founded by a queen of the slave-making species for example
it might be supposed finding two kinds of ants living together one
weaker and much more helpless than the other that the former lived a
parasitic existence in the nest of the latter and was not a
slave-owner at all; but this theory is disproved by the fact that no
males or females of the _tetramoriums_ are ever to be found showing
that it is not they but the others who are the true founders of the
nest
a still more extraordinary instance of a slave-holding species of ant
than the one just mentioned is _anergates atratulus_ for in this there
are no workers at all only kings and queens who are waited on and
their eggs and larvæ fed and tended by the slave species—_tetramorium_
in this case also—just as though these latter were their true-born
subjects here too the slave species is only represented by workers
these male and female _anergates_—a worker of the species has never been
known—are both few in number and weak in themselves when a pair of them
(or a fertilised queen) go off to found a new colony how do they or
how do their few weak descendants impress a strong fierce species into
their service by whom the nest is built and every other service
performed the question remains unanswered nobody knows several
theories have been advanced one by sir john lubbock who supposes that
the king and queen of _anergates_ assassinate the queen of _tetramorium_
and reign in her stead[] and another more recently by wasmann
whose idea is that fertile queens of _anergates_ are sometimes adopted
by a colony of _tetramoriums_ who have lost their own queen this last
is the newest suggestion and is considered just at present perhaps for
that reason the most probable to me sir john lubbock’s view seems
likelier to be correct since it is more usual in nature for the weak to
prey as parasites upon the strong than for the strong to seek
assistance of the weak true i can form no idea as to how the
assassination of the rightful queen takes place but nature is full of
resources and will do much to promote a really worthy end
i will conclude this chapter by quoting some remarks of sir john lubbock
as to the ill effects which the institution of slavery exercises with
ants as with men upon the character of the slave-holder “these four
genera” he says “offer us every gradation from lawless violence to
contemptible parasitism _formica sanguinea_ which may be assumed to
have comparatively recently taken to slave-making has not as yet been
materially affected _polyergus_ on the contrary already illustrates
the lowering tendency of slavery they have lost their knowledge of art
and their natural affection for their young! they are however bold and
powerful marauders in _strongylognathus_ the enervating influence of
slavery has gone further and told even on the bodily strength they are
no longer able to capture their slaves in fair and open warfare still
they retain a semblance of authority and when roused will fight
bravely though in vain in _anergates_ finally we come to the last
scene of this sad history we may safely conclude that in distant times
their ancestors lived as so many ants do now partly by hunting partly
on honey; that by degrees they became bold marauders and gradually took
to keeping slaves; that for a time they maintained their strength and
agility though losing by degrees their real independence their arts
and even many of their instincts; that gradually even their bodily force
dwindled away under the enervating influence to which they had subjected
themselves until they sank to their present degraded condition—weak in
body and mind few in numbers and apparently nearly extinct the
miserable representatives of far superior ancestors maintaining a
precarious existence as contemptible parasites of their former
slaves”[]
since however in all these cases the masters are still truly served by
their slaves who make them comfortable and have no more sense of their
degradation than they themselves have an answer might be made to these
moralisings however various the masks behind which true motives lie
hid happiness diversely conceived of is the one end and aim of all
does it then really much matter by what means it is attained till we
can show that these slave-holding ants have become less and less happy
we are only tilting at shadows and an _anergates_ might very well say
in regard to the above view “tut prut drop your heroics i am very
comfortable; these strong fellows work for me i like not working and
what i am i wish to be”

the relation of slave and slave-master—to use the received
terminology—is not the only one of a social and friendly nature in
which ants of different species stand towards one another; for as will
have been gathered in the previous chapter slavery amongst ants is a
quite friendly institution conducted in fact upon the
“liberty-equality-fraternity” principle some species of ants
however inhabit the nests of other species or build their own amidst
theirs in such a way as almost to make them one and thus they live as
perpetual guests not only without paying for such accommodation by
rendering their hosts any services but often forcing these latter to
be of service to them in other ways also thus a small species of
texan ant whose first or christian name is _leptothorax_ but whose
surname has not yet been fixed upon lives on these terms in the nests
of a larger one the celebrated _myrmica brevinodis_ whether
professor wheeler was the discoverer of the little ant i am not quite
sure but he was the first i think to observe its relations with the
big one and those of the big one with it and his account of them is
excessively interesting “a small dish” he says “containing a syrup
of sugar and water was placed near the nest (an artificial one under
close observation) this was soon found by two of the _myrmica_
workers which at once gorged themselves with the liquid and returned
into the nest”[] soon afterwards a _leptothorax_ worker entered it
also and having run or tracked down one of the two honey-gorged
creatures forthwith got up on to its back and seated there began
to lick its head an attention which it supplemented with a soft
persuasive titillation with its antennæ whilst at the same time
communicating a motion to its abdomen which professor wheeler is so
convinced must have been accompanied with certain sounds—known to the
learned as stridulations—that he does not hesitate to affirm that it
was thrown “into stridulatory oscillation” nor was the _myrmica_ deaf
to such an appeal it slackened its pace hesitated then paused and
as though unable longer to resist the influence folded its antennæ
and appeared to give itself up to the full pleasure of the thing the
tempter now still making soft play with the antennæ lowered its own
head and began to lick the _myrmica_ first on one cheek and then the
other including also the mandibles and parts adjoining thus
fostered a dewy moisture drawn evidently from the reservoir of
lately swallowed nectar began to glisten on the lips of the large
ant and increasing rapidly to a droplet was re-imbibed by the
expectant little one “the latter” says professor wheeler “then
dismounted ran to another _myrmica_ climbed on its back and
repeated the very same performance again it took toll and passed on
to still another _myrmica_”[] up to the present the attention of
professor wheeler had been concentrated on the doings of this one
individual but now turning his attention to other parts of the nest
he “observed that nearly all the _leptothorax_ workers were similarly
employed in one corner a number of _myrmica_ workers had formed a
circle about a few of their small larvæ which they were cleansing and
feeding a _leptothorax_ soon found its way to this cluster and
stepped from the back of one ant to that of another lavishing a
shampoo on each in turn and apparently filling its crop with the
liquid contributions thus solicited”
the above method of obtaining food appears to be peculiar to these ant
parasites beetles for example solicit it either by taps or touches
with the antennæ—which is a similar one indeed but does not go so far
nor involve a ride—or else by stroking the face of their host with their
fore-feet other species of ants when soliciting food from one another
or demanding it from their slaves employ a more or less similar method
whilst the _lepismid_ that we have before spoken of is a thief pure and
simple licking seems to be the personal discovery of _leptothorax_ and
being licked the peculiar privilege of _myrmica brevinodis_ that it is
a valued one is clear but the price asked for it is not always
forthcoming possibly because there is not always anything to forthcome
on such barren occasions _leptothorax_ makes the best of a bad job and
dismounting from its first love runs about looking for another
sometimes after having licked the head and face of its patron the poor
petitioner turns round and proceeds to do the same by its abdomen this
perhaps is a last effort of persuasion but professor wheeler rather
supposes the surface of _myrmica’s_ body to be “covered with some
agreeable secretion” queen _myrmicas_ however seem to be very rarely
treated to any sort of licking and males apparently never the reason
of this probably is that both queens and males are themselves
accustomed to receive their food from the workers by a similar process
of regurgitation and are probably therefore not in the habit of
regurgitating it they are therefore neglected by the little parasites
who console themselves by being all the more insistent with those who
have something to give these—that is to say the workers—are waylaid
whenever they enter the nest as having presumably found something to
eat outside it and in order to be on the spot at once their
importunate lickers who seem to live in a perpetual state of crying
“give! give!” keep in the more or less immediate proximity of the
entrance or entrances should there be more than one professor
wheeler indeed doubts if the _leptos_ ever feed themselves in the
ordinary way but inasmuch as they were on one occasion seen by him to
do so such doubt appears to me to be uncalled for
these little ants make in regard to the big ones within whose nest they
live a sort of _imperium in imperio_ in a small chamber surrounded by
the large galleries of the _myrmicas_ and communicating with these by a
passage too narrow for the latter to pass through lives the queen with
a small number of workers; eight of them in the nest observed by
professor wheeler together with a few larvæ almost filling the cavity
they appear to be on affectionate terms with one another the workers
feeding their queen in the most assiduous manner and she often playing
with them like a cat with her kittens throwing them on to their backs
and then “hugging and kissing them” (as professor wheeler describes it)
_con amore_ not that the professor himself takes this view of it for
after hesitating whether to ascribe such behaviour to maternal
affection “the play instinct” or hunger he decides for the latter—on
what grounds since there was a continual passage of viands from one ant
to another the queen especially being “assiduously fed” i am unable to
see what too is “the play instinct” except a mere term made use of
in order to suggest the idea of automatism in regard to an act which
hardly seems to admit of such an interpretation instincts represent
imperious necessities which if not attended to the species must fail
or perish such at any rate are the grounds on which they must be
supposed to have been originally built up but what creature has had to
play in order to survive not ants surely who work so hard that they
cannot stand in need of more exercise than their daily life affords
them nor it would seem is such an instinct developed amongst other
insects which again seems to show that it cannot be of any great
importance when therefore we find that ants the most wonderful of
all insects do play this strongly suggests their possession of an
intelligence analogous to that of the higher animals instinct however
is largely independent of intelligence such as we understand it and
therefore to allude to “the play instinct” in ants before the
instinctive character of the act has been made out is to prejudge the
question whether ants are automatic or reasoning beings
the smallness of the passages leading from the interior chamber of
_leptothorax_ to the broad galleries of the _myrmicas_ suggests that the
latter were not intended to pass through them; but we cannot really draw
this inference since an ant in tunnelling would allow for the size of
its own body but not for that of another species certain it is that
the big ants constantly force their way through the narrow passages
thus partly breaking down the wall and that they are then received by
the little ones in a quite friendly manner and persuaded to part with
some of their interior stores still when this has been effected their
friends seem mildly desirous that they should go and as soon as they
have gone set to work to repair the breaches made by their entrance no
sooner has this been done however than they are broken down again and
so it may continue apparently for an indefinite period at any rate in
nests constructed for observational purposes and where the conditions
are therefore more or less artificial whether it is so to anything
like the same extent under nature may well be doubted for that any
creature should live in a state of never-ending useless labour does not
seem likely; and moreover unless the one ant could have made itself
comfortable within the nest of the other why should it have become
established there at all but whatever it may be outside the study this
is professor wheeler’s account of what fell under his observation: “at
one pm” he tells us “the _myrmica_ workers discovered the
hiding-place of their little companions and two of them in single
file shouldered their way through the narrow passage enlarging it as
they proceeded as soon as the head of the first _myrmica_ appeared in
the chamber the _leptothoraxes_ which had been attending to their
morning toilet and that of their larvæ and to the careful arrangement
of their eggs turned to meet the intruders”
                              “now dreadful deeds
                          might have ensued”
and for such an upshot indeed upon the first occasion professor
wheeler was prepared “for an instant” he says “i fully expected to
see a fierce battle but i had misjudged the _leptothorax_ character to
my surprise the _myrmicas_ on entering were received with a profusion of
shampooing and though sadly crowding the occupants of the little
chamber they let themselves down comfortably and appeared to
experience all the sensuous satisfaction of a couple of _roués_ who have
dropped into a turkish bath for the night yet the little _leptos_
though behaving in this friendly manner” (their conduct indeed was not
more disinterested than upon other occasions) “seemed to have some dim
desire to remove the _myrmicas_ from their nest for from time to time
one was seen to pull with her mandibles at the fore leg or antenna of
one of the intruders as if to remind her that there are limits to
polite hospitality” professor wheeler adds that “this was the only act
even approaching hostility witnessed between the two species the
_myrmicas_ never showed the slightest irritation towards the _leptos_
never seized them in their mandibles or even menaced them they seemed
rather to look upon the little creatures with gentle benevolence much
as human adults regard little children they never passed their little
guests without the antennal greeting and the _leptos_ shampooed their
hosts with comical zeal”[] the continued breaking down and repair of
the dividing wall is then described with the conclusion that “in their
natural environment the _leptothoraxes_ would not be cramped for space
and would probably dig their cell where they would not so frequently be
disturbed by their inquisitive hosts”
as regards the possible effects upon the _myrmicas_ of having thus
frequently to render up food swallowed for their own nourishment it
must be remembered that amongst most ants this is a thing of custom;
and again it seems probable that there would be an internal sense on
the part of the regurgitating individual as to concessions of this
nature having gone as far as it was healthy that they should go as we
have seen they are not infrequently refused professor wheeler
however came to the conclusion that _myrmica_ colonies suffer very
considerably from this cause and on this he makes the following
comment: “if i have correctly estimated the influences which may tend to
diminish the fecundity and prosperity of the _myrmicas_ we have in this
double nest another striking demonstration of the complete absence in
ants of any faculty of reason for if the _myrmicas_ possessed a glimmer
of this faculty they could easily annihilate the gluttonous little
nest-mates that are for ever roaming about their galleries like so many
animated stomach-pumps”[] yes truly a _most_ “striking
demonstration” seeing that we human ants can annihilate all in a
moment any evil that has insensibly gained a footing amongst us and
with which we have been familiarised from birth custom growing
gradually from unnoticed beginnings plays no part at all amongst
us—never affects our views in the very slightest degree in europe we
hang up all the brewers and distillers; whilst mobs of infuriated
chinamen rend in pieces the vendors of opium and crushers of their
women’s feet there is no such thing in _human_ nature as tolerating an
evil for the pleasure that lives in it; no _man_ ruins his health and
sinks into an early grave through being a slave to sensual pleasures
nor can what is manifestly wrong seem right to _us_; there is no
pernicious obstinate wilful shutting of _our_ eyes what a contrast
does all this present with such a state of affairs as we are here
considering! and how plain it is that there can be no reasoning power in
the ant since reason and right conduct are synonymous with man!
what is the origin of these strange co-partnerships—for there are
others—which we find existing between ants of two different species
living in the same or in one double nest as we know the different
species of ants are commonly very hostile to one another; and for any to
enter the nest of some other one is to court destruction if they be not
the stronger party nay they dare not even enter a strange nest of
their own species it seems probable therefore—this at least is my
own view of it—that such friendly cohabitation has come about through
the channel not of peace but of war—through successful encroachments
which from being unavoidable have come gradually to be less and less
resented till the two parties mingling freely have learnt to live on
other terms now there are ants which live like ogres in the nests of
other species preying upon their eggs and young such a one is
_solenopsis fugax_—to whom we will come presently—but it is perhaps even
more interesting to find in species between whom relations of a similar
nature to those which we have been considering exist occasional slight
traces of a mutual hostility as between the _leptos_ and _myrmicas_
indeed this has only as yet been noticed very faintly on the part of
the former; but in regard to another pair who live together—our great
wood-ant namely _formica rufa_ and tiny little _formicoxenus
nitidulus_—professor wheeler remarks: “on one occasion in one of my
artificial nests in which the ants had previously lived on good terms
with one another i saw a _formica_ touching a _formicoxenus_ with her
antennæ and menacing her with her mandibles but she departed without
even attempting to seize her in the same nest i found a _formicoxenus_
which had seized the leg of a _formica_ in its mandibles and had died in
this position”[] other observers too have from time to time—but
only very occasionally—noticed facts of the same sort through such
exceptional slight indications we may perhaps see “as in a glass
darkly” what things were at the beginning
let us now look at the beginning _solenopsis fugax_ sir john lubbock
tells us “makes its chambers and galleries in the walls of the nests of
larger species and is the bitter enemy of its hosts the latter cannot
get at them because they are too large to enter the galleries the
little _solenopses_ therefore are quite safe and as it appears make
incursions into the nurseries of the larger ant and carry off the larvæ
as food it is as if we had small dwarfs about eighteen inches to two
feet long harbouring in the walls of our houses and every now and then
carrying off some of our children into their horrid dens”[] this is
the general proposition monsieur janet can add a few particulars “the
_solenopsis_” he says “may establish itself near almost any other ants
of our country and is found especially with” here follows a list
all in latin but our common wood-ant—the large one that makes those
great heaps of pine-needles—and the amazon or slave-making ant are
contained in it[] “the _solenopsis_ nest” continues m janet “may
partially surround that of its neighbour’s or it may even be partly
excavated in the masses of earth which separate the galleries of the
latter in each case—and probably too when as is frequent there is
not such close contiguity—fine connecting galleries enable the
_solenopsis_ to make incursions into the nests of their neighbours
where as we shall see they find an abundance of food the actual nest
consists of a number of small circular chambers about - mm in
diameter and only - mm in height most of these chambers are
separated from one another by several centimetres and are connected by
slender galleries often less than two millimetres in diameter entering
the chambers at their walls ceilings or floors which latter are
remarkably clean smooth and hard”[]
the food of which these horrid little ants find such an abundance is of
course the cocoons and larvæ of their unfortunate neighbours and m
janet gives the following account of the way in which they dispose of
them: “from ten to thirty of them” he says “climb up on to a cocoon
and cover it with little perforations which finally becoming
confluent enable them to reach its contents if it contains a pupa the
legs and antennæ fall an easy prey to the mandibles of the _solenopses_
in this case the victim is cut into sucked and torn into very small
pieces which the ants hasten to carry away into the interior of the
nest the operation is much more difficult in the case of a larva which
has just spun its cocoon such a one i have seen the _solenopses_ drag
into the interior of the nest and keep working at for twenty-four hours
at the expiration of this period the larva began to look flaccid (as may
be believed) and was covered with little black dots which were
sometimes double corresponding with the little wounds made by the
mandibles of its assassins numbers of the latter were busy lapping up
the liquid which exuded from the wounds but it was not until thirty-six
hours had elapsed that the larva was entirely devoured”[] this is
certainly not a pleasant picture yet if our surmise is correct the
remote descendants of these murderous _solenopses_ may become as
harmless and as pretty in their ways as the little _leptos_ a
reflection which goes far to discount any uncomfortable feelings we
might otherwise have been inclined to have in regard to the general plan
or scheme of things thus in nature though occasionally a slight
shadow may seem to rest upon the landscape the next moment the very
memory of it is lost in a blaze of sunlight glory
forel believes that when a _solenopsis_ and one of the larger species
of ants that it plagues meet the latter are unable to see it on
account of its small size so that practically it is invisible this
seems a strange doctrine since the same ants can see smaller things;
and yet from their behaviour under such circumstances m janet is
inclined to think so too it can hardly be that they shun combat though
the _solenopses_ in spite of their small size are able even here by
virtue of their numbers and being armed with stings to meet their
victims as one may almost call them upon equal terms m janet
indeed once saw so strong and warlike a species as the slave-making
_formica sanguinea_ killed by some half-dozen _solenopses_ but he adds
that on such occasions a considerable number of the latter were
generally killed also this however is not sufficient to abate the
evil so perhaps the molested species finding that fighting is of no
use accustomed to see _solenopses_ from their birth recognising too
as a part of their own atmosphere the distinctive smell which they no
doubt possess accept them like some disagreeable part of their lives
and try to make the best of it

    ant wonders—leaves cut for mushroom-growing—how ants plant
      mushrooms—a nest in a mushroom-bed—“psychic plasticity”—two
      opinions—ant stupidity—unfair comparisons—the ant and
      the servant-maid—mushroom-growing beetles—choked by
      ambrosia—intelligent uselessness—automatic phraseology—a
      curious insect
ants as everybody knows have a special faculty for doing extraordinary
things only a few of these have been mentioned in the last and
preceding chapters and only a few more can be touched upon in this to
do the subject anything like justice a whole large book would be
required not a few chapters merely of a quite small one what ants do
indeed reminds me of the refrain constantly repeated of a certain old
ballad lately brought to my notice viz—
           “wonders notable wonders! never the like was heard”
for instance they grow mushrooms (rice or some cereals they used to
grow and reap but lately they have not been allowed to); they use their
own larvæ as an implement to sew or stick things together with thus
making little shuttles of them; they make bridges of their own bodies
by which they pass over rivers—even wide ones it would seem at least
for them—which otherwise would be impassable; they allow themselves to
be made into honey-pots and kept full for the good of the general
community who take a little of them when they want it; they have
cemeteries and would appear even to feel something like awe or respect
in the presence of their own dead; they cause certain plants to grow and
come to maturity which would otherwise die in order to make a house in
them and so on and so on many other wonders equally notable to say
nothing of those which have already been recounted
to take the first on the list—i hardly believe in a classification of
wonders—belt who was an engineer but ought to have given up his whole
life to observations of this sort was the first i believe to find out
that ants were mushroom-growers like others when he came to nicaragua
he saw the leaf-cutting ants passing in long double columns backwards
and forwards between their nests and the trees the homeward-bound
column laden with their little crescent-shaped bits of green leaf the
outgoing one empty-handed “the first acquaintance a stranger generally
makes with them” says belt “is on encountering their paths on the
outskirts of the forest crowded with the ants; one lot carrying off the
pieces of leaves each piece about the size of a sixpence and held up
vertically between the jaws of the ant; another lot hurrying along in an
opposite direction empty-handed but eager to get loaded with their
leafy burdens if he follows this last division it will lead him to
some young trees or shrubs up which the ants mount; and where each one
stationing itself on the edge of a leaf commences to make a circular
cut with its scissor-like jaws from the edge its hinder feet being
the centre on which it turns when the piece is nearly cut off it is
still stationed upon it and it looks as though it would fall to the
ground with it but on being finally detached the ant is generally found
to have hold of the leaf with one foot and soon righting itself and
arranging its burden to its satisfaction it sets off at once on its
return following it again it is seen to join a throng of others each
laden like itself and without a moment’s delay it hurries along the
well-worn path as it proceeds other paths each thronged with busy
workers come in from the sides until the main road often gets to be
seven or eight inches broad and more thronged than the streets of the
city of london standing near the mounds one sees from every point of
the compass ant-paths leading to them all thronged with the busy
workers carrying their leafy burdens as far as the eye can distinguish
their tiny forms troops upon troops of leaves are moving up towards the
central point and disappearing down the numerous tunnelled passages the
outgoing empty-handed hosts are partly concealed amongst the bulky
burdens of the incomers and can only be distinguished by looking
closely amongst them”[]
it used to be supposed that these leaves themselves in a decaying
state were the food of the ants whilst another theory was that they
were used to make a sort of underground roof to the nest with belt’s
discovery took everybody—including himself—completely by surprise “i
believe” he says “the real use they make of them is as a manure on
which grows a minute species of fungus on which they feed: that they
are in reality mushroom growers and eaters”;[] and he thus narrates
the circumstances which led him to this conclusion:—
“when i first began my warfare against the ants that attacked my garden
i dug down deeply into some of their nests in our mining operations we
also on two occasions carried our excavations from below up through
very large formicariums so that all their underground workings were
exposed to observation i found their nests below to consist of numerous
rounded chambers about as large as a man’s head connected together by
tunnelled passages leading from one chamber to another notwithstanding
that many columns of the ants were continually carrying in the cut
leaves i could never find any quantity of these in the burrows and it
was evident that they were used up in some way immediately they were
brought in the chambers were always about three-parts filled with a
speckled brown flocculent spongy-looking mass of a light and loosely
connected substance this mass which i have called the ant-food proved
on examination to be composed of minutely subdivided pieces of leaves
withered to a brown colour and overgrown and lightly connected together
by a minute white fungus that ramified in every direction throughout
it”[] belt assured himself in many ways but not through actually
seeing them do so that this fungus was what the ants fed on and he
adds “that they do not eat the leaves themselves i convinced myself;
for i found near the tenanted chambers deserted ones filled with the
refuse particles of leaves that had been exhausted as manure for the
fungus and were now left and served as food for larvæ of
_staphylinidæ_ and other beetles”[]
belt’s conclusions have been since amply verified and the actual
process of preparing the leaves and laying down the mushroom-beds as
well as the clipping and—if i mistake not—eating of the mushrooms has
been observed herr möller—a german observer who resided for some years
in tropical america—is usually referred to in this connection; but such
extracts from his writings as i have come across are to me less
_convincing_ than the following account of mr edward tanner which is
contained in the _journal of the trinidad field club_[] the
observations were made with ants in confinement as were herr möller’s
also i believe “each forager” says mr tanner “drops her portion of
leaf in the nest which is taken up as required by the small workers
and carried to a clear space in the nest to be cleaned this is done
with their mandibles and if considered too large it is cut into
smaller pieces it is then taken in hand by the larger workers who lick
it with their tongues then comes the most important part which is
almost always done by the larger workers who manipulate it between
their mandibles the ant using her palpi tongue three of her legs and
her antennæ while doing so it now becomes a small almost black ball
varying in size from a mustard-seed to the finest dust-shot according
to the size of the piece of leaf that has been manipulated which varies
from ⅛ by ⅛ to ¼ by ¼ of an inch these balls really pulp are then
built on to an edge of the fungus-bed by the larger workers and are
slightly smoothed down as the work proceeds the new surface is then
planted by the smaller workers with slips of the fungus brought from the
older part of the nest each plant is planted separately and they know
exactly how far apart the plants should be it sometimes looks as if the
plants had been put in too scantily in places yet in about forty hours
if the humidity is regulated it is all evenly covered with a mantle as
if of very fine snow it is this fungus they eat and with small
portions of it the workers feed the larvæ”
the statement herein contained that the ants plant the new portion of
their mushroom-bed with slips or plants taken from the already growing
fungus is as far as i know new i do not remember it in herr möller’s
paper[] who speaks of the _hyphæ_ of the fungus growing through and
round the little leaf-balls within a few hours but without reference to
their being planted nor is it alluded to by professor wheeler who has
studied the mushroom-growing ant—whether the same or a similar species i
know not—in texas forel again speaking of an allied form in colombia
says “the largest workers triturate the leaves”; and again “the
medium-sized workers of the minim caste are for ever clipping the
threads of the fungus which then develops the ‘kohlrabi’ (the little
round swellings that is to say) on which the ants feed”[] possibly
this last may allude to the planting but if so it is the reverse of
clearly put professor wheeler also alludes to this constant clipping of
the fungus and sees in it the probable cause of the mutilation of the
antennæ of the little blind cockroaches that live with these ants and
take toll of their mushrooms[] but as these constitute the sole food
of their insect cultivators it is natural that the latter should
frequently clip in order to eat them and the clipping would no doubt
stimulate their growth all this however is different from the actual
deliberate planting of the fungus on newly laid-down portions of the
bed—an act which would imply a very clear intention and make the ants
farmers in the same way that we are this however need not be the case
if they only lay down the beds for these at one time probably
constituted their actual food the crop of fungus being merely
incidental but if the ants deliberately plant the fungus then indeed
they must know precisely in a human way what they are about
as we have seen the leaves from which in their state of pulp the
mushrooms spring are stored up by the ants in large underground
chambers; but these mushroom-beds or gardens as they are often called
are themselves a sort of nest containing tunnels and chambers and not
merely unformed heaps it is in one or other of these chambers that the
queen ant of the nest resides a majestic creature almost an inch long
but inflated both with pride and eggs to a disproportionate extent her
sons and virgin daughters who will some day be queens themselves keep
her company whilst all about in the galleries and all over the broad
flat surface of the garden which resembles a large flattened sponge
walk the different castes of workers some large some small some
medium-sized with a few big-headed soldiers here and there amongst
them as though to keep the crowd in order whether they have really any
such duty assigned them we do not know but they do not appear to do any
work whilst the others are all busy at something and the smaller
workers particularly keep threading the stalks and filaments of the
fungus in order to weed out any extraneous useless growth from amongst
it[]
it is a sad reflection—thus sighs professor wheeler—that so much ordered
energy such apparent intelligence should all be really due to—_what_
he does not seem to be quite certain about not automatism entirely
perhaps but if not then semi- or demi-semi-automatism tempered with
“psychic plasticity” against this view of the matter we have that of
belt who after giving two instances which came under his own
observation of intelligent adaptation on the part of ants to meet
particular circumstances exclaims “can it be contended that such
insects are not able to determine by reasoning powers which is the best
way of doing a thing or that their actions are not guided by thought
and reflection”[] but then belt was not provided with the term
“psychic plasticity” and without it he could only infer intelligence
from any intelligent act
still it cannot be denied that a great many instances have been
given—noticeably in the case of “_our_ ants” by sir john lubbock[]—in
which these paragons of insects have behaved very stupidly or shall we
say—for why should a creature that cannot be intelligent be stupid
either—with great “psychic _rigidity_” certainly such contradictions
are very puzzling but i would suggest one way of trying to estimate
better the rigid type of ant intellect which i believe to be absolutely
new and that is to compare it not with one’s own brain—or darwin’s—but
with that of a rigid type of person it is wonderful what a difference
this might make in our conclusions an ant for instance that is
unable under some special circumstances to get a thing down into its
nest because it persists in holding or pulling it in the way it has
always been accustomed to or another that would rather be blown into
the water along a known road than leave it for a new one makes a poor
figure in presence of the seven sages or amidst a circle of senior
wranglers mentally called up for its confusion; but we should think
rather of some pin-headed servant-maid setting an article of furniture
each morning in the place that with evident intention you have removed
it from overnight or making up a larger and larger fire as the weather
gets warmer and warmer one should think of the obstinacy with which
many people cling to old habits which changed times have made useless
or even harmful and of how numbers not only prefer inferior things they
are used to to the most decisive improvements but hate and revile such
improvements as though they were undeniable evils instances will occur
to everyone i would rather not mention any for fear of alienating nine
out of every ten of my readers we should think also of savages or
primitive slow-moving peoples what a great unadaptability for
instance did the matabele show in their methods of encountering our
countrymen during the war and throughout the rising; as also in that
rising itself since it was against all those well-known blessings which
our empire confers upon savages[] it is to these less exalted levels
of human faculty that we should look when we seek to compare an ant’s
mind—when out of its usual set track—with our own if we wish to do the
ant any justice that we pursue an opposite plan is my own explanation
of many a partial verdict to every experimenter in these directions
(who should happen to ask my advice) i would say first “do you know
or have you ever known a really silly person” and on his beginning at
once with “yes mrs” or “miss” (as the case may be) i would strike in
peremptorily thus: “then keep _her_—not newton—in your mind as a
standard of comparison”
that ants should intentionally cultivate mushrooms will appear wonderful
to everybody and some will see in it the high-water mark of their
mental development by whatever path it has been arrived at it seems
natural to connect such doings with the fact that “in ants the cerebral
ganglia are of extraordinary dimensions and in all the hymenoptera
these ganglia are many times larger than in the less intelligent orders
such as beetles”[] yet the brain of an ant—“one of the most
marvellous atoms of matter in the world perhaps more so than the brain
of a man”—is “not so large as the quarter of a small pin’s head”[] of
what size then can a beetle’s be—especially that family of beetles
which grow and cultivate mushrooms just in the same way that ants do
it would be suggestive—though i hardly know of what—should it be found
that comparatively speaking _they_ have no brain at all
the beetles alluded to have been named with reference to the particular
kind of mushrooms they grow ambrosia beetles though in what the great
superiority of these over those raised by the ants lies i do not know
for no one appears to have tasted them it has been agreed however to
call them ambrosia “one of the most remarkable facts” says mr
froggatt “is that each group of these beetles is associated with a
certain kind of ambrosia or fungus notwithstanding that they are found
in different timbers this substance is actually cultivated by the
mother beetle upon a carefully prepared layer or bed of wood-débris
generally at the end of the gallery; but in others the ambrosia is grown
only in certain brood chambers of peculiar construction whilst in
others again it is propagated in beds near the cradles of the
larvæ!”[] when the latter hatch they find a supply of celestial food
awaiting them and can walk about the various galleries feeding upon it
to their hearts’ content
in other cases however—that is to say with other species—social
development has gone further and besides boring galleries the
mother-beetle excavates a number of cells in their walls like rows of
bedrooms opening out of either side of a passage she does not however
quite finish her bedrooms but whilst they are still incomplete lays
an egg in each and when this hatches the young beetle then in its
larval state takes up the task where she left off and in time
completes it all the while they are growing up the mother feeds the
young ones and between the intervals of doing so stops up the
entrance to the cell with a “plug”—such is the word employed; “to what
base uses we may return horatio!”—of ambrosia in time when they have
acquired the full imago form each female beetle flies away to make a
burrow and rear a family of her own and in some species she is
accompanied in this marriage flight as it may be called by the male
in others however the males are wingless and remain in the burrow
till when their appointed time comes they die whether the male when
winged assists the female in her mining operations i am not quite sure
inasmuch as that point seems to be avoided in the accounts which i have
been able to consult but the wingless male would not be able to do so
as he would be left behind in the burrow when the female flew away to
found another colony
the fungus when it has once commenced to grow increases very rapidly
so that if the number of beetles in the nest is much diminished as
say by some accident the rest cannot eat enough to keep it down and
so it would appear are suffocated it is asserted however that when
the wingless males are deserted by the females and would otherwise
perish in this way they all collect together in a few of the galleries
and feast on the ambrosia there growing by this means we are told
they “prolong for a time their useless existence”—an ungrateful way of
putting it so it seems to me as the poor things have already been
useful in a very indispensable manner so that their existence as a
whole is anything but useless and to separate a part of it from the
rest and carp at that is silly as well as ill-natured but it is the
fashion to speak in this harsh way of the male insect beginning with
the drone bee; whereas when the female has done all that _she_ can
do—which is often just to lay her eggs—nobody talks of _her_ useless
existence fashion is a curious thing and ants even if they be
automatons are not the only creatures that do things automatically
it is certainly very curious if it be true that the wingless male
beetles should by thus congregating together in this way and so saving
their lives show more intelligence than the winged females who under
similar circumstances are choked with their ambrosia as the duke of
clarence was with his nectar in a malmsey-butt it is true that with the
males the thing happens every year whereas with the females it is only
accidental; but in the particular circumstances it is difficult to see
how inheritance can have had anything to do with it here then are a
particular family of beetles who live the same sort of social life that
ants and bees do which discovery appears to have been made by a mr
hubbard not so many years ago and from whose paper on the subject all
the above particulars have been taken though only through the medium of
various magazines since even at the british museum i was unable to get
the paper itself so long ago however as  a certain herr theo
hartig “published an article on the ambrosia of _xyleborno (bostrichus)
dispar_ in which he showed that it was a fungus growth (_pilzrasen_)
and he named the fungus _monilia candida_” this statement is made by
mr hubbard in his much more recent account not feeling perfectly
certain from it whether the origin as well as the nature of the
strange-named substance was not also divined by the german investigator
i quote the reference in order not to do him a possible injustice for
to me it seems that there have been few more interesting discoveries
than this of these ant-like ambrosia-growing beetles but why the ants
only grow mushrooms thus allowing themselves to be enormously outdone
by an inferior insect is more than i can understand
and now a word of justice to these beetles it might be supposed that
by burrowing into trees they caused the death of the latter but this
is not really the case writing in _the agricultural gazette_ of new
south wales for august  mr froggatt the government entomologist
makes the following statement absolving _xleborus_: “this curious little
beetle (_x solidus_) is rather plentiful about sydney and is
frequently sent to us taken out of the trunks of fruit trees which it
is supposed to have killed; but in all cases that have come under my
notice it has had nothing to do with the tree dying but is attracted to
the tree as soon as it becomes sick the bark begins to wither and the
first symptoms of decay set in” mr froggatt adds: “the instinct that
leads these and other wood-boring beetles to a tree as soon as it is
sick is something marvellous; in the tropics i have collected many fine
rare species upon the freshly cut tent-poles in our camp attracted to
the wood but otherwise seldom found in the bush” this instinct would
seem to be a remarkably developed scent though why a severed branch
should smell differently from the tree of which it but a moment before
made a part it is not easy to imagine however we cannot without
evidence attribute clairvoyance to beetles and perhaps it is the cut
from which the scent emanates
another example of an insect which is neither an ant bee wasp nor
white ant but which yet may be said to live a true social life is the
little creature which under the name of _psocus venosus_ and as
belonging to the order _carrodentia_ will be familiar to everyone it
is nearly related to the so-called book-lice but lives in the open air
“being seen” says mr leland howard “upon the trunks of trees in
flocks numbering from twelve to forty or fifty individuals”[] these
browse together like a herd of miniature cattle on the various lichens
that embrace the bark and these they nibble so closely that wherever
they move they leave a bare track behind them sometimes one family and
sometimes several are included in the herd all ages and stages being
represented from the wingless but free-moving larvæ to the winged imago
form the latter however though they be thus provided will not
readily forsake their young but the whole of them when alarmed first
run all together and then if the cause of disquietude continue
suddenly scatter as though in panic and run hither and thither in all
and every direction when the danger seems over they close up their
ranks again and go on browsing as before
the female _psocus_ lays her eggs in little clusters of from fifteen to
twenty and protects each cluster under a sort of dome or shield of
gnawed wood which she presses upon them so that they stick to it she is
said to brood over the eggs but this does not appear to mean that she
actually incubates them rather she remains about keeping watchful
guard till they are hatched and then takes the young to find pasture
walking at their head like a hen in front of her chickens from such
beginnings as these it seems possible that the social life of ants has
been in the course of ages evolved and developed
                              chapter xvi
    from wood to ambrosia—wood-boring beetles—rival claimants—stag
      and other beetles—metempsychosis—flies with horns—comical
      combatants—female encouragement—the sacred scarabæus—a
      beetle with a profession—table companions—old and new
      fallacies—from theft to partnership
it is no doubt through feeding on wood that the beetles we have been
considering came in time to feed on ambrosia the particular fungus
that is to say which for some unaccountable reason has received this
name appeared as a natural growth upon the walls of their tunnels and
in time it came to be thought necessary and its coming was arranged
for by similar steps probably the leaves once carried as food to
their nests by the sauba ants or cooshies have become the soil merely
on which that food is grown; and so i have no doubt myself that even if
the present agricultural ants of texas do not purposely sow and
afterwards reap the rice that springs up around the circular mound of
their domicile their descendants will do so indeed it seems rather
curious that with such facilities for a gradual development the habit
has not yet been acquired; and this is the chief reason which inclines
me to suspend judgment on the question and wait for further
observations far from thinking the thing too wonderful i wonder if it
be not the case such wonder however is for ants and not for beetles
except indeed ambrosia beetles who certainly merit it though in an
opposite way no other wood-borers of the order are anything but
wood-eaters or at any rate if a few feed on fungus as would not be
improbable should it happen to appear they have nothing to do with the
cultivation of it the words “as far as we know” however must be added
to the foregoing statement numbers of beetles pass the larval and pupal
stage of their existence within the trunk of a decaying or even of a
perfectly sound tree from which they issue after the final
metamorphosis has been made amongst these is our own stag-beetle in
whom that is to say in whose caterpillar some suppose themselves to
see the _cossus_ of the ancient romans which was as much appreciated by
them and no doubt justly as are earthworms by the chinese others
however believe this to have been the large red meaty-looking
caterpillar of the goat-moth; and as the one conjecture is quite as
plausible as the other the only or at any rate the best way of
arriving at a conclusion would be to try them both—a simple plan which
as far as i know has not yet been adopted
the stag-beetle—when of maximum size that is to say for it varies
amazingly in this respect—is much the largest beetle which this our
island possesses but though with its huge antler-like jaws it makes
a good perennial illustration for all books of popular entomology its
merits seem to end there for either there is nothing or nothing has yet
been observed particularly interesting about it no doubt if we look at
the matter from an absolute rather than a relative point of view the
second of these two explanations is the correct one for a creature has
only to be studied in order to become interesting; but as compared with
ants bees wasps and many other insects beetles or at any rate the
vast majority of them are not so very entertaining in their habits and
the stag-beetle has no superiority in this respect to correspond with
its size and uncommon appearance this appearance however is confined
to the male who alone possesses the great branching mandibles on which
its greater size also is largely dependent it would be natural to
suppose that these formidable weapons as they certainly appear stood
in relation to the combats of the males for the possession of the
females yet it is often stated that the short sharp pincers of the
latter which can be made it would seem—anyone who doubts may try—to
meet in the flesh are really the more efficient of the two be this as
it may it is not improbable that the stag-beetle’s jaws since they are
very handsome may have been developed less as weapons than as
ornaments under the laws of sexual selection darwin if i remember
was doubtfully of this opinion and he attributes many strange
projections and processes on the head or thorax of other beetles—as
notably that huge one with a snout like a weaver’s beam called the
hercules beetle—to the same agency no use for this extraordinary trunk
as one may term it has as yet been discovered but as the under portion
is covered with a thick matting of soft brown hairs it would seem as
though it had some office to perform unless indeed we suppose this
_chevelure_ to be likewise admired a lesser though still tremendous
projection starting from the head as the other one does from the
thorax is likewise unaccounted for for though the two together make in
appearance a pair of uncouth and irregular pincers they neither are
nor apparently can be used in this way nothing appears to be known of
this strange creature’s habits and the same may be said in regard to
most of the more remarkable-looking beetles of the world as well as
those which are not so extraordinary in their appearance the ways of
beetles in fact have been but little studied and it is perhaps not
too much to say that if for every thousand that fill the show-cases in
museums we could know the life-history of one we might with infinite
advantage in exchange for this knowledge throw the whole pin-forest of
them into the sea in what light this fact if true exhibits the
labours of those naturalists—as the world calls them—who living for
years amidst the life-teeming regions of the earth have spent their
whole time in constantly killing and killing coming home at last with
an acre of carcasses to write a book containing hardly anything of
first-hand observation—the soul of natural history—i will not pause to
inquire
[illustration: the hercules beetle
the enormous beetle from which this illustration was drawn though not a
particularly large specimen is six inches long and the upper jaw
measures three inches and a half]
there are many other species of beetles the males of which are
ornamented about the head and thorax with all sorts of knobs and
projections so that with some one might think that a one-horned or
two-horned rhinoceros had undergone metempsychosis as it is called
that its soul that is to say had transmigrated into the body of an
insect which latter had been fashioned so as fancifully to resemble its
old one however as this would be a downward journey it is more
satisfactory to imagine that certain beetles have been “translated” into
rhinoceroses as to these kinds of excrescences darwin believed them to
be of the nature of adornments and since their owners—the males—have
not been seen to use them in warfare and indeed do not appear to fight
it is difficult to imagine any other _raison d’être_ for them this
seems all the more likely because certain flies found in the malay
archipelago have likewise excrescences which we have to call horns and
these too are confined to the males though it is hardly to be imagined
that they would fight in a manner to make them of service these flies
must be most extraordinary creatures to look at they have long legs
which they draw together underneath them so as to stand very high and
their horns are not only conspicuous by their size and shape but also
by being brightly coloured thus in one species they are a beautiful
pink with a light stripe down the centre and bordered on each side with
black in another the colours are yellow black and brown and though
_elaphomia cervicornis_ has to be contented with black and pale tips
yet his are the finest pair of all being nearly as long as his body
and branched so as to look like a pair of slender and delicate stag’s
horns the other pairs are not like this one of them being rather
club-shaped and therefore less horn-like whilst another has an
extraordinary resemblance to the antlers of an elk which are broad and
palmated so that _it_ is the _elaphomia alcicornis_ here therefore
are both horned beetles and horned flies who yet do not fight with their
horns so that unless they serve as ornaments it would be a puzzle to
say what they do serve as; for as the male beetles do not fight which
is the principal way in which male creatures including man show their
vigour why should we suppose them to be more vigorous than the females
in some other beetles which do fight the sexes do not differ
conspicuously nor do their facial or other peculiarities appear to bear
any special relation to warfare thus “those curious little beetles the
_brenthidæ_” of the malay archipelago have an extraordinarily long
snout—or rostrum to talk entomologically—at the end of which come the
jaws and antennæ and this rostrum is used by the female to bore holes
in decaying wood where she afterwards deposits her eggs the males
however do what they can with them as weapons and dr wallace has seen
two of them fighting together in a very comic manner “each” he tells
us “had a fore-leg laid across the neck of the other and the rostrum
bent quite in an attitude of defiance and looking most ridiculous”[]
on another occasion “two were fighting for a female who stood close by
busy at her boring they pushed at each other with their rostra and
clawed and thumped apparently in the greatest rage although their
coats of mail must have saved both from injury the small one however
soon ran away acknowledging himself vanquished”[] _lethrus
cephalotes_ is another fighting beetle and here the males instead of
horns or anything extraordinary have merely somewhat larger mandibles
than the females “the two sexes” says darwin “inhabit the same
burrow if during the breeding season a strange male attempts to enter
the burrow he is attacked; the female does not remain passive but
closes the mouth of the burrow and encourages her mate by continually
pushing him on from behind; and the battle lasts until the aggressor is
killed or runs away”[]
of yet another species the _ateuchus cicatricosus_ the sexes “live in
pairs and seem much attached to each other; the male excites the female
to roll the balls of dung in which the ova are deposited and if she is
removed he becomes much agitated if the male is removed the female
ceases all work and as m brulerie believes would remain on the same
spot until she died”[] but m brulerie was reckoning apparently
without m fabre since whose investigations in this last department it
may be said that “_nous avons changé tout cela_” for this _ateuchus_ is
none other than the celebrated scarabæus or sacred beetle and in the
first place m fabre has shown that the balls of dung which are rolled
about by them with so much perseverance and energy do not contain the
ova as it was always thought that they did but are merely provender
and nothing more and though sometimes they are rolled by two beetles
together these are not the male and female or at any rate they need
not be they are just as likely to be two males or two females and in
any case though the two may be of opposite sexes they do not represent
a mated pair simply when the two—if as is by no means always the case
more than one take part in the rolling—have pulled and pushed the ball
to a suitable place they make a hole in the ground into which they
drag it and having closed the aperture sit and feast at their
leisure
according to fabre the vital principle contained in the egg would be
destroyed were it rolled about in this fashion so when the mother
scarabæus who it would appear works in this matter alone is ready to
lay her eggs she first makes an excavation and then brings the dung
down into it in pellets till there is a heap of it which fills the
whole concern then “the first thing to do is to select very carefully
taking what is most delicate for the inner layers upon which the larva
will feed and the coarser for the outer ones which merely serve as a
protecting shell there around a central hollow which receives the egg
the materials must be arranged layer after layer according to their
decreasing fineness and nutritive value; the strata must be made
consistent and adhere one to another; and finally the bits of fibre in
the outside crust which has to protect the whole thing must be felted
together”[]
thus when the grub first issues from the egg it finds light digestible
food ready to hand which becomes coarser and more fibrous with its
growth and increased capacity of assimilating such stronger diet as
more and more is eaten the ball which is about the size of an ordinary
apple becomes hollower and hollower till at last when only the outer
crust remains the grub is ready to enter upon that wonderful series of
changes—called its metamorphoses—which will bring it forth into this
larger ball of dirt a complete beetle with a useful profession that
of scavenger immediately open to it
thus a fallacy which according to fabre dates from the time of the
pharaohs viz that every ball of dung which one might at any time see a
scarabæus beetle rolling and trundling along contained its egg has been
finally disposed of nor is this the only one it used to be thought
not only that any two beetles rolling a ball between them were male and
female but also that any single one that happened to be in difficulties
would immediately fly off and summon a comrade or two to its aid fabre
denies this altogether and maintains that in this rolling away of
provisions each individual beetle is purely a self-seeker it is true
as we have seen that the _bonne bouche_ will often be eaten by two
scarabæi—never more—in the cavern prepared beforehand for its reception
but according to fabre this is only because it is to the mutual
interest of both to act in this way since neither can succeed in
appropriating the ball to itself in spite of efforts—which in other
cases however may be successful—to do so
in all such cases the one beetle is the real owner of the ball whilst
the other is only there with the intention of stealing it if he can
thus the thief will often let himself be pushed along by the honest
worker lying flat on the ball and doing no work whatever though at
other times when a rise in the ground makes it difficult for a single
beetle to roll it he will assist with all his power again whilst the
one scarabæus is hollowing out a cave for the approaching banquet to
take place in the other left with the ball will after some time
begin to go off with it alone and unless pursued by the owner before he
has gone too far he accomplishes his purpose and eats it all himself
thus he has associated himself to the maker of the ball with the
distinct idea of stealing it if he can he has this plot in his mind to
pretend partnership to even give real assistance but to watch his
opportunity and decamp when it occurs that at least is the view
suggested for our adoption but i cannot say that it recommends itself
to me fabre in my opinion has disposed of one error only to fall into
another of precisely the same kind he says very justly in regard to the
idea that one beetle would deliberately fly away and summon others to
its assistance “it is no slight thing to admit that an insect has a
truly surprising grasp of the situation and a facility for
communicating its ideas to others of its kind more surprising still are
we to suppose that a scarabæus in distress conceives the idea of begging
for help flies off explores the country round etc” very true; but
if we are not to suppose this i certainly will not suppose either
that this same scarabæus can conceive the idea of pretending to assist
another in order to rob him of his property this would be as deep a
laid scheme as the other and the facts of the case as given by fabre
himself do not appear to me to lend themselves to such an explanation
the point of these interesting relations has been in my opinion
entirely missed what we really see in them or what at least is there
for us to see is the beginnings of order and social polity evolving
themselves out of lawlessness and the strong hand further it has
already gone some little way for the fact that two scarabæi do as a
matter of fact assist each other very materially in rolling the ball
and that they do sit and eat it together in the same chamber are not to
be got over by any such amusing fancy picture as this brilliant writer
as well as keen observer has given us it is no use fixing our eyes
upon that part of the conduct of the beetle which we are invited to call
the thief in contradistinction to the owner—i doubt myself if fabre has
always kept the two distinct from beginning to end—if we pass over the
other and much more interesting parts of it why does this beetle help
to get the ball up a hill and why does he sit for some considerable
time with it outside the cave that the other is making before he begins
to go off with it does he say to himself in the first case “if we
don’t get it to the right place to begin with he’ll never dig a hole
and leave me outside with it” and in the second “i’ll wait till he
has come out and found it all right several times so that his
suspicions may be put to sleep” this would be scheming with a
vengeance; but _serviteur monsieur fabre_ i must refer you to your own
incredulity in another matter i will never accept such an explanation
and the view which i take of the whole affair is this the beetle which
fabre calls the thief is under the sway probably of precisely the same
feeling as the other one—the rightful owner he has seized a piece of
dung and as he seizes it whether another has it at the time or not it
appears to be his that being the only idea of rightful ownership which
is not too large for his comprehension finding however that another
beetle has exactly the same idea as himself he is forced willy
nilly—and the experience is being constantly repeated—to accommodate
himself to this circumstance and make the best of it the ball—this is
the one great advantage—will continue to roll even if he does not push
it therefore he can afford to be lazy sometimes and be pushed along
with it the ball stops: in that case he must push it and even without
this incentive it would appear from fabre’s account that the two often
work together thus from the very necessities of the case it is
evident that a sense of partnership—at least a feeling of doing work in
combination with another—has begun to dawn in the mind of the scarabæus
the fact that when the one beetle is left alone with the ball whilst
the other excavates it does not immediately go off but stays a little
as though waiting to be rejoined suggests to my mind that this feeling
fostered by custom has already gone some way though it is not
wonderful that after a time the primitive individualistic tendency
should again assert itself but when the fugitive is overtaken it
assists the other to roll the ball back and the end of it all is a meal
shared peacefully between the two in one common apartment if we
suppose that the instinct or capacity of working together for some
common end has had any beginning surely we might expect to find it in
some such state of affairs as this the result of primitive conceptions
is that two scarabæi are often obliged to roll one ball between them
and if there be any advantage in this arrangement natural selection
will no doubt do the rest that it has already begun to do it is i
think very probable; but fabre was not an evolutionist

      strange observation—two views of ants
mushroom-growing especially if the ants plant the mushrooms in the way
stated by mr tanner is just as extraordinary i think as their habit
of planting a field with ant-rice and reaping it at the proper time
would be did they really practise it up to a little while ago it
certainly seemed as though they did for there was dr lincecum’s
definite statement based upon twelve years’ observation and this if
not confirmed by mr mccook was at any rate not contradicted by him
on the contrary mccook mentioned a good many facts pointing in the
direction of lincecum’s assertion and though he did not consider them
decisive he could see no reason why the ants should not act in this
way as indeed there is none: so that as he had only stayed a few months
where lincecum had lived for twelve years he seemed like a weaker
witness supporting according to his opportunities of observation a
much stronger one now however comes another witness whose
opportunities have also been great and in a somewhat heavy-handed way
in a spirit of myth-slaying and irrelevant reference to supposed
schoolboy knowledge hardly required in face of all that ants are known
to do denies the whole thing
first however let us have the assertion as originally made by
lincecum which is that on the summit of the mound of their nests from
which they carefully clear away all other vegetation the harvesting
ants sow the seed of a certain plant called ant-rice for the purpose of
subsequently reaping a harvest of the grain it is sown in time for the
autumnal rains to bring up and at the beginning of november a green row
or ring of ant-rice about four inches wide is seen springing up round
the circumference of the _disk_ (as the circular top of the mound is
for some reason always called) in the vicinity of this circular ring
the ants do not permit a single spire of any other grass or weed to
remain a day but leave the aristida or ant-rice untouched until it
ripens which occurs in june of the next year after the maturing and
harvesting of the seed the dry stubble is cut away and removed from the
disk which is thus left unencumbered until the ensuing autumn when the
same species of grass again appears as before and so on[] after
stating in a letter to darwin that he has seen all this taking place
year after year dr lincecum adds:—“there can be no doubt of the fact
that the particular species of grain-bearing grass mentioned above is
intentionally planted in farmer-like manner the ground upon which it
stands is carefully divested of all other grasses and weeds during the
time it is growing when it is ripe the grain is taken care of the dry
stubble cut away and carried off the paved area being left unencumbered
until the ensuing autumn when the same ant-rice reappears within the
same circle and receives the same agricultural attention as was bestowed
upon the previous crop and so on year after year as i _know_ to be the
case in all situations where the ants’ settlements are protected from
graminivorous animals”[] lincecum also believed that the ants were
able in some way to prevent the seed stored in their nests from
germinating this same fact has been asserted and apparently proved by
moggridge in regard to the harvesting ant of southern europe and he
also states that if in spite of the precaution any seeds begin to
sprout the ants by gnawing off the tips of the radicles would prevent
the germination from proceeding
this then is the case _for_ the harvesting ant as we may say; for if
these things be true they are certainly much to its credit whereas if
not the scandal is so great that it ought to change its name let us
now hear the case against as stated by professor wheeler after which
readers may make up their minds if they can for i have not quite done
so yet i quote in full so that the two statements may be balanced
against each other and this i hope will be more interesting than the
usual “mr so and so however disputes this and thinks etc”—another
line or two in which the contrary proposition of the one before is
stated at about the same length this is what professor wheeler who
“speaks home—you may relish him more (or at least as much) in the
soldier as the scholar”—has to say: “it may not be altogether out of
place in this paper to record a few other observations on _pogonomyrmex
molifacieus_ inasmuch as this form has been singled out among all the
known members of the genus as presenting certain remarkable instincts
lincecum is responsible for the myth that this _pogonomyrmex_ sows a
certain species of grass the ‘ant-rice’ (_aristida oligantha_)
protects it from harm and frees it from weeds while it is growing for
the purpose of reaping the grain this notion which even the texan
schoolboy (not macaulay’s who probably knew as much about it) has come
to regard as a joke has been widely cited largely because the great
darwin stood sponsor for its publication in the journal of the linnean
society mccook after spending a few weeks in texas observing the ant
in question and recording his observations in a book of  pages
failed to obtain any evidence either for or against the lincecum myth
and merely succeeded in extending its vogue by admitting its
plausibility two years of nearly continuous observation enable me to
suggest the probable source of lincecum’s and mccook’s misconceptions
in either case the observer has started with a few facts and has then
stopped short to draw inferences before gathering more facts if the
nests of _molifacieus_ be studied during the cool winter months—and this
is the only time to study them leisurely and comfortably since the cold
subdues the fiery stings of their inhabitants—the seeds which the ants
have garnered in many of their chambers will often be found to have
sprouted it is therefore certain that these ants are not able to
prevent the seed from germinating as moggridge claims for the european
species of messar except by conveying them to drier chambers; and in
protracted spells of wet weather even this precaution seems to be of no
avail on sunny days the ants may often be seen removing these seeds
when they have sprouted too far to be left for food and carrying them
to the refuse heap which is always at the extremity of the cleared
earthern disk or mound in this place the seeds thus cast away as
inedible often take root and somewhat later form an arc of tall grass
more or less closely approximating to a complete circle round the nest
since these ants feed largely though by no means exclusively on
grass-seeds and since these particular seeds are a very common and
favourite article of food it is easy to see how their grass should
often predominate in the circle in reality however only a small
percentage of the nests and only those situated in certain localities
present such circles now to state that the ant like a provident
farmer sows this cereal and guards and weeds it for the sake of
garnering its grain is as absurd as to say that the family cook is
planting and maintaining an orchard when some of the peach-stones which
she has carelessly thrown into the backyard with the other kitchen
refuse chance to grow into peach trees”[] certainly such a thing
should have been observed before the statement was made and if it has
not been the facts seem more probably accounted for on the above
explanation
professor wheeler goes on to say that “there are several other facts
which show that the special ring of grass about the nest is an
unintentional and inconstant result of the activities of the ant colony
for instance one often finds very flourishing ant-colonies that have
existed for years in the midst of much-travelled roads or in stone
side-walls often a hundred or more feet from any vegetation whatever
(without any ant-rice on their mounds therefore) again it is very
evident that even a complete circle of grass like those described by
lincecum and mccook would be entirely inadequate to supply more than a
very small fraction of the grain necessary for the support of a
flourishing colony of these ants hence they are always obliged to make
long trips into the surrounding vegetation and thereby wear out regular
paths which radiate in different directions often to a distance of
forty to sixty feet from the entrance of the nest the existence of
these paths which are often found in connection with grass-encircled
nests is alone sufficient to disprove lincecum’s statements”[] it
certainly seems easier to suppose that lincecum misinterpreted certain
facts not themselves in dispute than that an explanation on which so
many considerations seem to throw doubt is the correct one one thing
at least seems certain—if some of these ant communities grow grain of
set purpose all of them do not this may be possible but more proof of
it than lincecum has brought is demanded if the ants really sow and
reap the grain that grows upon their mounds and more especially if
they carefully keep the patch clear it ought not to be difficult to see
them doing so this last would be decisive whereas the other two are by
no means so
that ants should use their own larvæ like a shuttle and for the same
purpose seems as strange a thing as one can well imagine but there is
no doubt at all about it the act having been witnessed on various
occasions by competent observers whose evidence is mutually
corroborated the species in question is common in eastern asia and is
accustomed to make little houses or arbours for itself by bending leaves
round so that the edges meet and then fixing them together as some
caterpillars do now the larva can do something which the grown ant
cannot which is to spin a cocoon from a sort of gummy thread-like
substance which issues from the mouth whilst one group of ants
therefore join to keep the leaf bent in the proper position another
take each a larva in their jaws and pass it from edge to edge of the
leaf applying its mouth to each edge until the two are bound firmly
together[] whether this is a more or less remarkable habit than
growing mushrooms it would be difficult perhaps to decide nor is
there any need to try since such questions are more interesting left
uncertain
it is well known or at least credibly asserted that ants cross rivers
by clinging one to another from the branch of a tree overhanging the
water till the end of this living chain as it becomes longer and
longer is carried by the force of the current to the opposite bank
where a bridge is formed over which the main body marches[]
according to du chaillu the ants in africa make not only a bridge but
a tunnel—“a high safe tubular bridge through which the whole vast
regiment marches in regular order”[] these are the celebrated driver
or bashikouay ants who when upon their terrible marauding marches put
every living creature including man to flight though for many flight
is in vain size and strength are here no protection “the elephant and
gorilla fly before them; the black men run for their lives” so says du
chaillu and sure enough when the skins of some of the poor gorillas
he shot arrived in england several of these ants were found amongst the
hair[] in the forests of equatorial africa abounding—if they have
not all been shot by this time—with large animals these hunting-raids
must give rise to some stirring scenes what crashings through the trees
and undergrowth! what uncouth sounds perhaps of mingled pain and rage!
how a bitten gorilla would express himself! what a subject for a picture
if a herd of elephants a few families of gorillas a score or so of
lions with a few leopards and baboons perhaps a rhinoceros and any
number of antelopes were all to come rushing down together to where an
artist stood ready for them! i should like to see the picture he would
draw
 the greatest beasts of the forest will fly before these terrible little
                                 insects
              one of which is shown in the left-hand corner
a more remarkable sight even than an ant-bridge is perhaps an ant-nest
by which i mean not an ants’ nest in the ordinary sense of the term
but a nest made of ants the following quotation from the
much-containing _naturalist in nicaragua_ page  will explain this
hard saying “they make their temporary habitations in hollow trees and
sometimes underneath large fallen trunks that offer suitable hollows a
nest that i came across in the latter situation was open at one side
the ants were clustered together in a dense mass like a great swarm of
bees hanging from the roof but reaching to the ground below their
innumerable long legs looked like brown threads binding together the
mass which must have been at least a cubic yard in bulk and contained
hundreds of thousands of individuals although many columns were
outside some bringing in the pupæ of ants others the legs and
dissected bodies of various insects i was surprised to see in this
living nest tubular passages leading down to the centre of the mass
kept open just as if it had been formed of inorganic materials down
these holes the ants who were bringing in booty passed with their prey”
of the many curiously constructed or strangely produced dwellings of
ants this made out of their own bodies is amongst the most remarkable
many ants live in the interior of various plants the plant generally
benefits as much as the insect by this arrangement so that there is a
mutual dependence between the two which in some cases is carried to
such an extent that the life of one or both seems a necessary part of
that of the other in borneo for instance a certain large tuber which
grows on the branches of aged trees is always found inhabited by a
certain red ant of small size but fierce disposition which rushes out
and attacks anyone who ventures at all near its dwelling the seed of
this tuber is disseminated in the same way as is our own mistletoe
through the agency of birds that is to say the seed being surrounded
by a similar pulpy mass which adheres to the branch on which it falls
soon after germination the tuber which is shaped something like a
carrot begins to develop but whilst still quite small its growth
ceases and in this state it would remain and before long die if it
should not happen to be found by the ants in question if it should be
however its life is assured they immediately bore a hole at the base
of the stem upon which this enlarges to a great degree so that soon
there is room for them to excavate galleries in the cellular tissue of
the interior and to form a populous colony the whole tuber is soon
perforated in all directions and becomes a living and growing
formicarium the great accretion of cellular tissue which has made this
possible having been caused by the poison—if we may call it so—of the
ant’s bite in the same way as the sting of the gall-fly raises galls
upon the oak[] of course from the moment that the ants appear the
tuber is safe from any other insect or small bird or mammal that might
otherwise do it harm the ants in defending their nest would defend it
and it is on this principle of mutual advantage that such ant and plant
alliances have been brought about
thus the dry arid plains called savannahs of tropical america support
a species of acacia of which the thorns characteristic of the family
grow in pairs and are shaped exactly like the horns of some oxen every
pair of these horns becomes in time an ants’ nest and if the tree be
touched or shaken the ants rush out full of fury in defence of their
habitations thus every tree is tenanted by a large army of retainers
who almost more than the thorns themselves which have been developed
for the same purpose protect it against browsing quadrupeds its
thorns however would be no protection against the leaf-cutting ants in
search of materials for their mushroom-beds whereas these are kept at
bay by a hostile species smaller indeed but armed with a powerful
sting “for these services” says belt “the ants are not only securely
housed by the plant but are provided with a bountiful supply of food;
and to secure their attendance at the right time and place this food is
so arranged and distributed as to effect that object with wonderful
perfection the leaves are bi-pinnate (double that is to say) and at
the base of each pair of leaflets on the mid-rib is a crater-formed
gland which when the leaves are young secretes a honey-like liquid
of this the ants are very fond; and they are constantly running about
from one gland to another to sip up the honey as it is secreted but
this is not all; there is a still more wonderful provision of solid
food at the end of each of the small divisions of the compound leaflet
there is when the leaf first unfolds a little yellow fruit-like body
united to it by a point at its base examined through a microscope this
little appendage looks like a golden pear when the leaf first unfolds
the little pears are not quite ripe and the ants are continually
employed going from one to another examining them when an ant finds one
sufficiently advanced it bites the small point of attachment; then
bending down the fruit-like body it breaks it off and bears it away in
triumph to the nest all the fruit-like bodies do not ripen at once but
successively so that the ants are kept about the young leaf for some
time after it unfolds thus the young leaves are always guarded by the
ants; and no caterpillar or larger animal could attempt to injure them
without being attacked by the little warriors” thus as mr belt very
aptly puts it “the ants are really kept by the acacia as a standing
army to protect its leaves from the attacks of herbivorous mammals and
insects”[]
as for the honey or honey-pot ants they were first heard of in america
and various floating stories which seemed more or less hard to credit
having got into circulation about them without there being any positive
knowledge to check them dr mccook to remove this grave reproach to
transatlantic entomology started off one day to observe them he soon
found that the main fact which had been stated was correct viz that a
certain sect or caste of these ants disregarding the italian warning
were in the habit of making themselves all honey to be swallowed in
consequence by the rest of the community these are the so-called
honey-pots and so well do they deserve their name that when full the
abdomen becomes almost perfectly circular like a glass globe and so
enormously swollen that the body in proportion to it is like a grain of
wheat stuck into a cherry or gooseberry[] the legs dangle towards the
ground but hardly or only by a great effort reach it and in this
last state of distension the insect may find it impossible to get about
though as a rule by dragging or pushing herself along sideways she is
able to do so to a certain extent these honey-jars have special
chambers for their accommodation and here they hang in clusters from
the roof awaiting the visit of any worker who upon signifying his
wants—it would seem after climbing up to them—is fed after the ordinary
ant manner by regurgitation in the same way the honey-bearers are
themselves filled or more properly speaking feed themselves since the
mouth arrangement in spite of the direction in which things seem
hastening has not yet become so simple as in the case of a real jar
the honey which the rotunds as mccook calls them receive from the
workers is gathered at night and is obtained almost entirely from the
galls of oak trees which when pierced by the ant’s mandibles exude a
white transparent liquid in minute globules this is greedily licked up
by the ants and distributed by them after the return home not only to
the rotunds but to such of their fellow-workers as may not have taken
part in the expedition[] the honey thus obtained is pleasant to ant
and human taste alike and the indians of new mexico as no doubt
elsewhere obtain it by the simple process of squeezing the
insect—breaking the honey-jar as one may say they also make from it a
fermented liquor having intoxicating powers so that one need not wonder
that the idea of farming the honey-ant like the honey-bee has been
seriously discussed in the united states mccook however has pointed
out that “the limited quantity of the product would prevent a profitable
industry” and he adds: “besides the sentiment against the use of honey
thus taken from living insects which is worthy of all respect would
not be overcome”[] personally i think it would be overcome and
pretty quickly too as are most other sentiments that stand in the way
of pleasure or profit women would get it under first as in the case of
birds seals etc and the world would soon follow with “woman’s
influence” upon its lips but let me not be unjust i do not believe in
sentiment as a working force in the case at all if the ants are not to
be squeezed it will be on commercial considerations
that the worker-ants—and for that matter the others also—are extremely
fond of the honey so curiously stored by them will be easily believed
and an unpleasant illustration of their greediness in this respect was
often observed by mccook when capturing a nest the swollen bodies of
the rotunds on these occasions were sometimes unavoidably ruptured
whereupon such workers as happened to be near these unfortunates
forgetting their alarm which had hitherto been great and the ruin and
confusion all around them paused in their flight or aimless movements
and greedily lapped up the overflowing honey[] it is all the more
interesting therefore to learn that when the “little life” of these
poor honey-pots is at length “rounded with a sleep” their contained
treasure though so easily obtainable goes with them to the grave the
idea of opening the full crop and imbibing the contents never seeming
to occur to any ant this is all the more remarkable in that the
workers when they recognise that life is extinct carefully separate
the abdomen from the thorax by sawing through with their mandibles the
little connecting stalk called the petiole the two parts are then
removed separately that representing the head half being carried
whilst the “golden bowl” of the body “unbroken” though with “the spirit
fled for ever” is rolled along the various chambers and galleries of
the nest till it finally finds a resting-place in the cemetery just
beyond its precincts[] to what are we to attribute the
non-utilisation of the honey in the dead body even were it possible
that the ants could forget that it was there they cannot be unconscious
of what must be smelt as well as seen through the semi-transparent
walls of the abdomen some feeling must restrain them—what i am not
prepared to say in a work which does not aim at being scientific
here then we have one most suggestive illustration—“suggestive” i
think is a very useful word—of the funeral habits of ants many others
could be instanced but i will end this chapter and small account of
ant doings generally with the following extract from the _proceedings
of the linnæan society_ () the observer was a mrs hutton of
sydney; and romanes who quotes her account in his _animal
intelligence_ remarks that though she is not a well-known observer the
facts reported were such as scarcely to admit of a mistake personally
i attach no weight whatever to anybody’s not being known as an observer
want of leisure or unpropitious circumstances generally must prevent
large numbers of people from seeing what they would be very well able to
note accurately if they did or from recording what they do see; whilst
on the other hand leisure joined to taste in a certain direction
makes many a quite average observer known as a good one a good
observer in fact is rather one who is always keeping on and does not
weary than one who can see a single salient thing more plainly than
most other people; and again it is easy to set a fictitious value
merely on being before the public
having thus defended mrs hutton i proceed now to quote her account: “i
saw” she says “a large number of ants surrounding the dead ones”
(soldier ants which she had herself killed and left lying on the ground
some half-hour previously) “and determined to watch their proceedings
closely i followed four or five that started off from the rest towards
a hillock a short distance off in which was an ants’ nest this they
entered and in about five minutes they reappeared followed by others
all fell into rank walking regularly and slowly two by two until they
arrived at the spot where lay the dead bodies of the soldier ants in a
few minutes two of the ants advanced and took up the dead body of one of
their comrades; then two others and so on until all were ready to
march first walked two ants bearing a body then two without a burden;
then two others with another dead ant and so on until the line was
extended to about forty pairs and the procession now moved slowly
onwards followed by an irregular body of about two hundred ants
occasionally the two laden ants stopped and laying down the dead one
it was taken up by the two walking unburdened behind them and thus by
occasionally relieving each other they arrived at a sandy spot near the
sea the body of ants now commenced digging with their jaws a number of
holes in the ground into each of which a dead ant was laid where they
now laboured on until they had filled up the graves this did not quite
finish the remarkable circumstances attending this funeral of the ants
some six or seven individuals had attempted to run off without
performing their share of the task of digging; these were caught and
brought back when they were at once attacked by the body of ants and
killed upon the spot a single grave was quickly dug and they were all
dropped into it”
“prodigious!” as dominie sampson would have said and certainly i think
this is one of the most remarkable observations upon ants that has ever
been made as far as the burying is concerned it has been corroborated
by the rev w farrar white who at the same time corroborates pliny;
but how strange are all the circumstances! what was it one wonders
that made just a few of the crowd shirk their share of the labour—for
this is not like ants some strange uncanny feeling in connection with
the dead bodies may be suspected; but seeing that as the russian
proverb truly says “another man’s soul is darkness” it is not very
likely that we shall ever know what ants feel
one interesting question is suggested in this connection though i have
never known it raised yet two views of what ants are excluding
compromises may be taken—the automatic one tempered with “psychic
plasticity” of professor wheeler and that formed by mr belt who
having fully satisfied himself—from the keenest observation be it
remembered—of their reasoning powers and capacities remarks “when we
see these intelligent insects dwelling together in orderly communities
of many thousands of individuals their social instincts developed to a
high degree of perfection making their marches with the regularity of
disciplined troops showing ingenuity in the crossing of difficult
places assisting each other in danger defending their nests at the
risk of their own lives communicating information rapidly to a great
distance making a regular division of work the whole community taking
charge of the rearing of the young and all imbued with the strongest
sense of industry each individual labouring not for itself alone but
for all its fellows we may imagine that sir thomas more’s description
of utopia might have been applied with greater justice to such a
community than to any human society”[] now if belt’s view be the
correct one or if the evidence in favour of it be at all strong is it
not time for us to ask ourselves merely as a moral problem how far we
in our clumsy and imperfect human state have a right to kill ants and
tumble utopia to pieces simply for our amusement intellectual or
otherwise ought we to do this or ought we like a lady who lives in
america and writes to very scientific papers to imprison queens who do
no harm and make ourselves learned at the expense of one or both of
their antennæ during the term of their natural lives however simply
and sweetly we may talk of this however much true womanly feeling may
enter into the narrative nay even though we give the queens pet names
is it really right

    bees and wasps—a bee’s masonry—what happens to
      caterpillars—living food—variations in instinct—a wasp’s
      implement—unreal distinctions—a cautious observer—bees that

the consideration of ants naturally leads to that of bees but of the
life and doings of the hive-bee—made common now in a hundred practical
treatises and bee-keeper’s manuals—it is not the design of this little
book to treat wasps are less written about but even here in a work
which can only deal with a very few insects out of a very great many a
choice may be permitted one so i will merely observe in regard to the
common species that in my opinion wasps are much less irascible than
bees—in fact quite good-natured compared to them—but at the same time
owing to their room-entering table-pillaging propensities much greater
nuisances so that they deserve stern treatment but a more charitable
estimate of their character hornets again—which seldom offend in this
way—appear to me to be very peaceable insects as though wielding a
mighty weapon they felt that they had no need to use it except on “a
striking emergency” such a definition would apply to the running of a
stage-coach diligence omnibus waggon etc—in fact any large
vehicle—into their nest on the highway in which case the consequences
one may well believe would be appalling never having been in such a
position myself and being without trustworthy information on the
subject my powers of description are useless here but there is a way
of dealing with this emergency also this reminds me however of an
account which i have read somewhere or other of hornets having once
stopped a roman army this may seem surprising nowadays but we must
remember that in classical times armies did not possess artillery there
is therefore nothing invidious in the opinion which i here express that
however much they may have stopped the romans they would never stop the
japanese
in both ants and bees we find solitary and social species so as in ants
we have been considering the latter only we will now reverse the
process with bees there are many interesting species of solitary bees
but it must be premised that the word “solitary” is to be understood
here in a special rather than in a general sense as far as mere numbers
are concerned there is often a large community of bees building their
cells in close proximity all at the same time but each builds its cell
for itself alone or rather for its family—no one thinks of helping its
neighbour there is no co-operation in fact and that makes all the
difference it would be all the same to every one of the bees that are
building so close together if all the rest went away and left it to work
alone and yet we cannot even quite say this because in one case at
any rate though every individual bee makes its own cell and thinks only
of that and of its own family yet when all the cells are finished the
whole community join in making one mud roof over the whole of them by
this we see how difficult it is to find quite separate places for allied
animals and how the habits of one are apt to slide gradually into those
of another still we must do the best we can and take words as we find
them remembering that the locusts as already explained do _not_
belong to the _locustidæ_
    aelian in his “natural history” says that a city in crete
      was attacked by such a plague of hornets that the
      inhabitants were driven to abandon it and build a new city
      on another site a hornet is shown to the right of this
      inscription
amongst the best known of the solitary species of bees are the carpenter
bees the carding and tapestry bees and the mason bees of the latter a
great french observer who though he lives now belongs really to the
days of réaumur and swammerdam has something to tell us speaking not
of réaumur’s maison bee—that “splendid hymenopteron with its dark violet
wings and costume of black velvet”[]—but of a smaller
species—_chalicodoma sicula_—he says: “you should see the active bee at
work when the road is dazzling white in the hot sunshine between the
neighbouring farm where she is building and the road where the mortar is
prepared there is a deep hum of the bees perpetually crossing each other
as they come and go the air seems traversed by constant trails of
smoke so rapid and direct is their flight those who go carry away a
pellet of mortar as big as small shot: those who come settle on the
hardest and driest spots their whole body vibrates as they scratch with
the tips of their mandibles and rake with their forefeet to extract
atoms of earth and grains of sand which being rolled between their
teeth become moist with saliva and unite they work with such ardour
that they will let themselves be crushed under the foot of a passer-by
rather than move”[] then comes the making of the actual nest or
little collection of cells “after choosing a boulder” says fabre “she
comes with a pellet of mortar in her mandibles and arranges it in a
ring on the surface of the pebble the forefeet and above all the
mandibles which are her most important tools work the material which
is kept plastic by the gradually disgorged saliva to consolidate the
unbaked clay angular pieces of gravel as large as a small bean are
worked in singly on the outside of the still soft mass this is the
foundation of the edifice other layers are added until the cell has
the required height of three or four centimetres the masonry is formed
by stones laid on one another and cemented with lime and can stand
comparison with our own layers of mortar sparingly used hold them
together the cell completed the bee sets to work at once to store it
the neighbouring flowers especially those of _genista scorpius_ which
in may turn the alluviums of the torrents golden furnish sugared
liquids and pollen she comes with her crop swelled with honey and all
yellow underneath with pollen dust and plunges head first into the
cell where for some moments one may see her work her body in a way
which tells that she is disgorging honey her crop emptied she comes
out but only to go in again at once this time backwards with her two
hind feet she now frees herself from her load of pollen by brushing
herself underneath again she goes out and returns head first she must
stir the materials with her mandibles for a spoon and mix all
thoroughly together when the cell is half full it is stored; an egg
must be laid on the honey paste and the door has to be closed this is
all done without delay the orifice is closed by a cover of undiluted
mortar worked from the circumference to the centre two days at most
seem required for the whole work”[] afterwards several more
cells—making a continuous group of from six to ten—are added and when
all is completed the mason bee “builds a thick cover over the whole
group which being of a material impermeable to water and almost a
non-conductor is at once a defence against heat and cold and damp this
material is the usual mortar made of earth and saliva only with no
small stones in it the nest is now a rude dome about as big as half an
orange; one would take it for a clod of mud flung against a stone where
it had dried nothing outside betrays its contents—no suggestion of
cells none of labour to the ordinary eye it is only a chance splash of
mud”
of course when the eggs are hatched the bee larvæ feed on the stored
pollen and honey a pleasing picture which suggests another something
like it though not altogether the same i allude to certain species of
solitary wasps which urged by the same feelings of maternal
solicitude choose a living caterpillar grasshopper spider etc for
the future sustenance of their young take for instance _ammophila
urnaria_ of north america whose habits in this respect have been
carefully studied this wasp is about an inch long with very long legs
and a waist even exaggeratedly wasp-like it is black in colour but
with a red mark running round the fore part of the abdomen at the
proper time she—for of course we are dealing with the female—may be
seen running about the ground and eagerly searching the various plants
and grasses that come in her way occasionally as though in lightness
both of heart and body she gives a leap off the ground and at other
times will fly up from it more deliberately to make an examination of
some overhanging leaf at last as a result of these little aerial
excursions let us say she knocks down a certain green caterpillar of
the kind wanted and with maternal devotion full upon her at once sets
to work the caterpillar however though taken by surprise and
assaulted the instant it has touched the ground resists strenuously as
though instinctively knowing and highly disapproving of the fate in
store for it it is larger and more bulky than the wasp and its
contortions are so powerful that the latter is several times repulsed in
her assaults she is not discouraged however but continues
perseveringly to fly at the caterpillar till at last she takes it at a
disadvantage possibly in a moment of weariness and alighting with her
long legs on each side of the large soft body seizes it by the neck
with her mandibles and holds it fast now the caterpillar stimulated
doubtless by the painful or at least unwelcome nip struggles with
redoubled energy; but it is beneath its oppressor who straddling over
it and never relaxing her grasp lifts it at last with an effort a
little from the ground and inserting her curved abdomen like a fish
hook beneath it strikes in a more effective and certain way than did
ever the most benevolently contemplative member of all the fishing
fraternity the result is instantly apparent for with the entry of that
deadly sting into its body all struggles on the part of the caterpillar
cease and it lies a living corpse at the feet of its cruel oppressor
the latter after remaining still for some moments as though to give her
victim time to realise and appreciate its situation stings it again and
then again each time choosing as she has done before for the locality
of the operation the junction of two out of the dozen or so segments
into which the long length of the caterpillar is divided then she flies
up but after circling a little above the scene of her triumph she
descends again and gives her victim though now helpless and paralysed
a taste or two more of her quality the first part of her business is
now done and well done she has earned a rest or rather she may
exchange one form of activity for another accordingly she proceeds to
indulge in the pleasures of the toilette and it is not till this is
completely finished that she flies with or drags her victim to the
neat little burial-place representing also her future nursery which
she has already provided for it[]
the above illustration is taken from the account of a particular case
which fell under the keen observation of g w and e g peckham two
well-known american entomologists on other occasions however this
wasp—that is to say various individuals of the same species—besides
stinging the caterpillar went through another and more curious process
this consisted in biting and squeezing the anterior upper portion—the
neck as we may call it—of their victim[] the same operation was also
observed by fabre when he watched his good mothers but though i have
called it biting and squeezing that is not the right term for a
_savant_ to employ _he_ calls it malaxation which perhaps means
doing both at the same time biting however would seem to imply no
less but perhaps in order to bite scientifically it is necessary to
take a piece out or at least to make the blood come though in common
parlance this does not or did not hold good since sampson bit his
thumb at abram and balthasar in the first scene of _romeo and juliet_
but it cannot be supposed—nor does the context support such a view—that
he bit it so hard as that malaxation however let it be; but why such
a process on the part of the wasp should be necessary it is not easy to
see since the mandibles are not poisonous like the sting and the
latter is all in all sufficient to produce the paralysis required as is
apparent in the instance already given where the sting alone was
employed to me it seems possible that this malaxation may be a
happiness to the wasp merely as the shaking of a rat certainly is to a
terrier whatever other advantages accrue from it that insects like
other animals including man—who indeed is the crowning instance—take
a savage pleasure in overpowering and killing their prey i have myself
very little doubt
we have seen that this wasp stung the caterpillar between the segments
of its body and as we will assume—for the result seems to warrant the
inference—in the central part of it so that the sting entering the
great nervous cord or ganglion which is situated in this region with
little swellings at each of the segmental rings produced the described
paralysis it was fabre’s view that this must always be the case and he
thought likewise in accordance with his own observation that the
caterpillar received a sting at the junction of all or nearly all the
segments of its body otherwise it would be imperfectly stung and in
consequence not sufficiently paralysed to prevent its struggling and so
detaching the young larva or perhaps the egg which as it would seem
is laid on and not inside the body of its living provisions on the
other hand were the caterpillar stung too severely so as to be killed
outright the grub when hatched would only have putrid meat to feed
upon and this again it was assumed would be fatal to its existence
on these grounds fabre concluded that we had here an instinct which must
have been perfect from the beginning since as anything short of such
perfection would be followed by the death of the larva those gradual
steps by which on the theory of natural selection all excellence
either of structure or instinct has been attained could not in a case
like this have had any existence
but all this has been exploded by subsequent observation what fabre saw
he knew but in all that he inferred without seeing he was entirely
mistaken as observed by the peckhams a caterpillar may be either stung
so slightly as to be quite lively and yet not succeed in shaking off
the wasp larva hatched on its body or so severely as to die almost
immediately yet without detriment to the larva who feeds on its
discoloured and more or less putrified body with the same gusto and
apparent benefit as though it were warm with life[] thus the
question seems not so much to be how can such perfection of instinct as
was observed by fabre have been attained through the process of natural
selection as why it should have been attained; or perhaps we may even
go further and ask if this supposed perfection exists at all and
whether fabre did not deceive himself a wasp having secured a
caterpillar is of course at liberty to sting it as often as it
pleases why then should one wasp behave quite like another one in
this respect here as elsewhere there would be some amount—perhaps a
considerable amount—of variation in individual disposition and wasps of
milder or less savage mood would sting less frequently than their
fiercer fellows there might therefore as it appears to me be a large
amount of fluctuation both in the number and degree of severity of the
stings—if indeed there is any regulation in this respect—and also in the
consequent injury to the caterpillar or other insect without any
particular scope being offered for natural selection to play a part
what room indeed for such a force can there be if it makes no
difference to the wasp-grub whether the caterpillar which is to be its
food is stung badly or slightly or whether it lives or dies
that this is really the case seems to be implied in the following
paragraph which i quote from the same interesting work that i have
before referred to[] “the conclusions that we draw from the study of
this genus differ in the most striking manner from those of fabre the
one pre-eminent unmistakable and ever-present fact” (the invariable
fact as one might say) “is variability variability in every
particular—in the shape of the nest and the manner of digging it in the
condition of the nest (whether closed or open) when left temporarily in
the method of stinging the prey in the degree of malaxation in the
manner of carrying the victim in the way of closing the nest and last
and most important of all in the condition produced in the victims of
the stinging some of them dying and becoming ‘veritable cadavers’ to
use an expressive term of fabre’s long before the larva is ready to
begin on them while others live long past the time at which they would
have been attacked and destroyed if we had not interfered with the
natural course of events and all this variability we get from the study
of nine wasps and fifteen caterpillars”![] fabre’s ideas therefore
seem totally disproved but though natural selection—the counter-theory
to his own—has no doubt produced the _sphex_ and _ammophila_ with their
habit of stinging and storing caterpillars to serve as food for their
young it does not follow that it has done anything more than this; for
though variation be the stuff in which natural selection works it need
not always work in it—any more than a tailor need always make clothes
because there is an abundance of cloth
    in the upper part of the picture a solitary wasp is seen
      attacking a caterpillar on a leaf beneath is another of the
      same species busy pounding the entrance to its burrow with a
      pebble
in the digging and closing of her burrow—her nesting-habits as we may
call them—our _ammophila_ is almost as interesting to watch as in her
mode of proceeding with caterpillars though here a certain well-known
stimulus to human enjoyment which i need not enlarge upon is wanting
having found a convenient spot for her nursery she digs with her
mandibles and front pair of legs a little tunnel in the ground to
about the length of her own body and at the end of it hollows out a
round chamber or cavern just large enough to make comfortable quarters
for a pair of invalid caterpillars—a hospital for incurables we may
call it to begin with but soon to become their tomb having dug to
about her middle the wasp backs out with a little pellet of collected
earth held firmly in her mandibles with this she flies to a little
distance and then letting it drop alights on the ground and takes a
little rest before returning to continue her work she may either fly or
run back for her legs are as highly developed as her wings—she is in
fact a very perfect athlete the process of excavation is now continued
there is more burrowing more flying away with the earth dug out and
before long the nursery-vault is completed the next thing is to find
caterpillars for it but before flying away to look for one _ammophila_
carefully conceals the entrance to her tunnel with pellets of earth
which she often brings from a distance and will not be satisfied with
unless they seem well adapted for their purpose at last when the
aperture is both blocked and hidden she starts off upon the still more
important undertaking which has been already described and after a
longer or shorter interval—if her quest is successful—returns with a
nicely stung caterpillar as two are required there must be another
journey and another stopping up of the burrow before the final one
which is of a more solid nature occupying sometimes as much as twenty
minutes in thus bringing her labours to a conclusion _ammophila_ often
shows a wonderful degree of intelligent foresight—foresight we must term
it if we admit the intelligence; for sometimes she will drag a leaf over
the entrance to the tunnel though now filled in or taking a stone as
large as her head in her mandibles will pound down the earth with it to
make it firm and compact[]
it used to be said—and may be still by that large class of people who
are for ever making false parallels and artificial distinctions—that man
was the only animal that made intelligent use of an instrument but
darwin instanced a monkey cracking a nut with a stone and an elephant
breaking off a bough to fan itself with here in an insect we have a
case which is perhaps even more to the point—more extraordinary that is
to say; for certainly the idea of flattening and pressing down earth
over a general surface and of taking something to do it with seems a
little less obvious than that of cracking a nut in a similar manner
and therefore to require more thought in the planner of such a process
no wonder that the delighted witnesses of this interesting fact flung
themselves on the ground on each side of the unconscious inspirer of
their wonder in order to have a better sight of it; but that a previous
observer of the same thing should have waited a year before publishing
what he had seen because he feared such a statement would not be
believed[] is to my mind a display of prudence almost as wonderful
though not nearly so edifying as that of _ammophila_ herself if we are
not to make known what we see because people who believe in their own
and nobody else’s eyesight are not likely to credit it how is evidence
to accumulate for the benefit of the more intelligent part of the
community it is only of this small minority that we should think or
rather we should not think of anything but the truth where truth is
concerned
returning to bees of the solitary kind “the operations of the
wood-piercers” says bingley “merit our careful attention” they shall
have it for a moment but space is against them however the female of
the species _xylocopa violacea_ which for some reason is disliked by
householders bores in the springtime by the aid of her strong
mandibles alone neat little circular tunnels in such objects as
garden-seats gates front doors arbours window-shutters rustic
tables and the like at first it is stated she “bores
perpendicularly but when she has advanced about half an inch she
changes her direction and then proceeds nearly parallel with its sides
for twelve or fifteen inches if the wood of the seat door table
etc be sufficiently thick she sometimes forms three or four of these
long holes in its interior a labour which for a single insect seems
prodigious and in the execution of it some weeks are sometimes
employed on the ground for about a foot from the place in which one of
these bees is working little heaps of timber-dust are to be seen these
heaps daily increase in size and the particles that compose them are
almost as large as those produced by a hand-saw”[] when the tunnels
are finished the mother bee divides them into some dozen little rooms
about an inch deep making the divisions of wood-dust which she cements
together by aid of a glutinous secretion with which she is furnished
before each cell is closed it is filled with a paste composed of the
farina of flowers mixed with honey (it makes one envy the grub) and an
egg is deposited in it as each cell takes some time to make and
provision it is obvious that the egg in the lower one will hatch a
little sooner than the one above it and so on right up to the top if
therefore any one of the larvæ “were to force its way upwards which it
could easily do it would not only disturb but would infallibly destroy
all those lodged in the superior cells”[] here however natural
selection (called providence in bingley’s time) steps in and “has
wisely prevented this devastation for the head of the nymph
(chrysalis) and consequently of the emerging bee is always placed in a
downward direction”[] of course therefore the insect moves forward
in the direction towards which it looks at birth—its new birth that is
to say; and moreover—this is the really astonishing thing—“the mother
digs a hole at the bottom of the long tube which makes a communication
between the undermost cell and the open air by this contrivance as all
the bees instinctively endeavour to cut their way downward they find an
easy and convenient passage for they have only to pierce the floor of
their cells in order to make their escape and this they do with their
teeth very readily” as regards this communicating passage however it
is presumably a mere continuation of the tunnel and was probably once
occupied with cells like the upper portion why the lower end of the
tunnel should have come in time to be left empty—what advantage that is
to say its being so represents—it is not easy to see but possibly it
stood in danger of being reached by a bird’s beak through what has now
become the exit of escape merely
as there is a leaf-cutting ant so too there is a leaf-cutting bee
but here the resemblance ends since no thought of food or fungus enters
the mind of the latter insect her more simple and direct object is to
make the severed leaves into cells and this she does with wonderful
skill and ingenuity the cells which are made by rolling the pieces of
leaves round within a tunnel or gallery previously excavated in the
earth are separated from one another by a circular piece which fits
into the tube with extreme nicety making at once the ceiling of each
lower compartment and the floor of that above it as each is finished
the bee as in the other instances fills it with a mixture of honey and
pollen upon which she then lays an egg and finally closes the mouth of
the tunnel the leaf principally used for the manufacture of these
pretty cradles is the rose leaf and the paste which fills them is of a
rose-red colour owing to the pollen having been collected for the most
part from thistles
the children of the leaf-cutting bee therefore are delicately housed
but what are they in this respect to those of the poppy or tapestry
bee who are born like the byzantine princes in a “purple[] chamber”
made of the rich leaves of poppies here they lie or crawl in state
one to each royal apartment which is filled almost to the brim with
the sweet food of bees yet when they come forth at last it is not as
gorgeous imperial creatures clothed in “purple and pall” but only
little ordinary-looking black bees covered all over with dirty grey
hair and their beautiful purple poppy chamber has been seen by no
one—not even by themselves probably—buried as it is full three inches
deep in the earth wallace somewhere in his _malay archipelago_
moralises over the beautiful little kingbird of paradise sparkling out
its life amidst the forest solitudes of a remote island unseen by human
eyes save those of savages till once or twice perhaps in a century
some wandering white man who alone is capable of appreciating its
beauty comes to bang its life out and bear away its skin the thought
of this dainty little crimson-tapestried bower lying in black darkness
like a grave beneath one’s feet rouses a similar train of reflection in
the mind but perhaps it would do so more strongly were it associated in
the same degree with ideas of sport or profitable collecting
the carding-bee is interesting not so much for the nest which it makes
as for the wonderful way in which it makes it—or to express it more
justly it is more especially interesting on this account having either
made or found a suitable cavity these bees under-roof it with a thick
thatching of moss to carry this bit by bit to the place would take
them a very long time so instead of doing so they stand one behind
another with their backs toward the nest in a line that reaches from
the moss to its entrance the furthest bee then pulls out a piece with
her mandibles cards it with her fore feet and with the others passes
it on beneath her body to the second bee who passes it to the third
the third to the fourth and so on all down the line the last bee
entering the nest with it thus these bees do with moss exactly what
rats have been seen to do with eggs when transporting them to their
burrows a most interesting anecdote of this is quoted by romanes[]
from jesse’s _gleanings_ but it does not appear to be in my edition
which i had thought was a complete one all i can find is a bare
reference to their having been known to “convey” eggs from a box in
this way—“convey the wise it call” this is an annoying discovery for i
detest all selections not made by myself from palgrave’s _golden
treasury_ to any man’s “hundred rest books” but if my edition _is_ a
complete one then the thing should be looked into for the anecdote
quoted by romanes is not there—at least it is untraceable through the
index
like ants bees are subject to parasites and as some belonging to the
former are ants themselves so with bees we have the same thing but
developed to a still more striking extent; for there is no ant that i
know of that lives with another which it so closely resembles that the
latter is unable to distinguish it from itself such bees however
there are some of our humble bees for instance go through life thus
attended by a double whose existence it never for one moment suspects
the two indeed are linked in the closest bonds of social intimacy
together they leave the nest together they fly from flower to flower
together they re-enter it together too they seem to glow in
industry—to emulate each other’s toil but all the while that the true
industrious bee is collecting pollen and nectar the double is only
pretending to do so—or rather let us say seeming—and whilst the former
bustles about feeding the larvæ and making the cells the latter only
bustles about like the shadow of a busy person on the wall but when
the true bee lays an egg the double lays one too almost at the same
moment and in the very same cell both are then hatched together and
the two larvæ grow up in the same cradle nourished by the same food
make their transformation side by side and so creep forth into the
nest the two as i say are hardly to be distinguished one from
another yet all the while one is a real true-hearted humble bee and
the other a mere show a stage make-up an outer shell without any of
the proper qualities inside and the best of the joke is that
probably the false or cuckoo bee as it is called is as much deceived
as its foster relatives and imagines itself a good honest sterling
member of the community it is forced by nature to cheat but the fraud
is unconscious and the impostor is imposed on in its turn
thus in the insect world we have something which can only be brought
about amongst ourselves through a conscious disguise by means of
wigs false moustaches etc—what we call an impersonation—but here is a
life-long impersonation which costs the “born actor” no trouble why is
this what is the meaning of it why should one bee—or any other insect
or creature—look just like another one and yet have a latin name of its
own which the other has no right to why should the individuals of one
species be hardly more like each other than they are like the
individuals of another species even though—as is often the case—these
two species are widely separated in the system of nature such are the
questions to which a consideration of these cuckoo-bees as they are
called give rise they will be answered if at all in the following

everybody knows nowadays how all the different species of animals and
plants living and extinct have come into existence it was quite
simple all they had to do was to keep on varying some of them varied
in a way that was good for them some in a way that was bad the latter
died but the others increased and multiplied and as the process was
always going on and it is impossible to vary long without becoming
changed it happened that creatures which had started with a certain
appearance got in time to have quite another one so that they would not
have been recognised by the people who used to know them if these same
people had kept alive however as the process was so slow that it took
millions of years and is still going on awkward things of this sort
never happened and so as nobody had ever seen one species of animal
change into another before their eyes they found it difficult to
believe that they ever had done so; for the ordinary person says
“seeing’s believing” though he believes in all sorts of things that
neither he nor anyone else ever has seen or is ever likely to still
for all that he thinks his own eyesight must be better than anyone
else’s
this process of eternal change with the changes for the better
surviving and those for the worse dying out is what is called natural
selection and if we understand it—as there are few now who do not—we
can understand this that if any kind of creature is so strong and
formidable that it would be an advantage for weaker creatures to be
mistaken for it then it is not at all unlikely that some of these
weaker creatures will get more and more to resemble it until at last
they are so mistaken for instance our common wasps who are armed with
a formidable sting and are very skilful in using it are not attacked
by any other insect excepting hornets which are not common any fly or
moth therefore that resembles a wasp will be generally left alone and
the more so the more it resembles it accordingly we do find flies and
moths that look very like wasps and live safely in consequence still
more would it be of advantage to look like a hornet and there is a moth
so like one that it is called the hornet-clear-wing
on this same principle of being mistaken for something that is safe from
attack or annoyance all sorts of animals and in a special degree
insects have come to look like various objects around them and amidst
which they live such as stems of grass pieces of moss or stick
leaves flowers and so on—some of the resemblances being more special
and extraordinary these are things which though the eye may see it
does not as a rule dwell upon because there are so many others round
about who for instance would look at any particular blade of grass
so a bird that would pounce down upon an insect that it saw moving
amongst the leaves of a tree if there was no doubt that it was an
insect would not take any pains to examine what only looked like one
leaf amongst many
thus throughout nature we have these curious resemblances of certain
creatures to certain other creatures or to the plants or inanimate
objects around them but it is principally amongst insects that the
phenomenon is met with probably because they increase and multiply so
quickly that there has been more time both for the laws of inheritance
and for the great controlling one of natural selection to have come into
play whatever is the reason there is no doubt about the fact which
will be best illustrated by one or two salient instances
ants though they fall a prey to various animals larger than
themselves—such as birds or ant-eaters—yet in their relations with other
insects occupy a position of comparative safety on account of their
weapons and pugnacity and still more of their numbers the driver
ants of equatorial africa and their south american representatives the
_ecitons_ are indeed when they set out on their foraging expeditions
the terror not only of insects but of all animal life “wherever they
move” says bates referring to the latter “the whole animal world is
set in commotion and every creature tries to get out of their way”[]
this however as they climb trees and send out encircling columns
which enclose a considerable extent of ground is difficult or rather
impossible for all such as cannot fly some distance without alighting;
for if an ant or two once seize upon them all is over an insect
therefore that cannot evade the onset of such an enemy is lucky if it
has some such means of ensuring its safety as has been above referred
to one at least thus specially favoured inhabits nicaragua “i was much
surprised” says mr belt “with the behaviour of a green leaf-like
locust this insect stood immovably amongst a host of ants many of
which ran over its legs without ever discovering there was food within
their reach so fixed was its instinctive knowledge that its safety
depended on its immovability that it allowed me to pick it up and
replace it amongst the ants without making a single effort to escape it
might easily have escaped from the ants by using its wings but it would
only have fallen into as great a danger for the numerous birds that
accompany the army of ants are ever on the outlook for any insect that
may fly up and the heavy flying locusts grasshoppers and cockroaches
have no chance of escape”[] this locust resembled a green leaf which
as we have seen was a very protective resemblance indeed it might
however had it been a smaller insect have resembled one of the ants
themselves and in that case could have run about with them pretending
or appearing to forage also with perfect impunity whether the _eciton_
has such a double i know not but various ants have with some it is a
spider that assumes their form with others as we have seen to a
partial extent a caterpillar but the _sauba_ or leaf-cutting
ant—which is also the mushroom-growing one—is understudied leaf and
all by an insect which though the order to which it belongs has been
determined has not yet apparently received a name “an example” says
professor poulton “of protective mimicry which i believe to be more
wonderful in its detail and complexity than any which has been hitherto
described was observed and interpreted by my friend mr w l sclater
in  during his investigations in british guiana mr sclater and
his native servant had been collecting insects by shaking the branches
of a tree over a sheet the servant although described as a very acute
observer saw an insect on the sheet which he mistook for one of the
abundant cooshie ants (perhaps the native name) carrying its little
jagged segment of leaf over its back mr sclater looked more closely
and saw that it was an entirely different insect belonging to the order
_homoptera_ its length was about that of an ant carrying its leaf the
leaf was represented by the thin flattened body of the insect which in
its dorsal part is so compressed laterally that it is no thicker than a
leaf” (or as we would say which along the back is no thicker than a
leaf) “and terminates in a sharp jagged edge the head and legs were
brown and suggested the appearance of that part of an ant which is
uncovered by the piece of leaf the jagged dorsal line when seen in
profile evidently corresponds to the roughly gnawed edge of the
fragment of leaf for mr sclater tells me that the contour of the
latter is generally shaped by the mandibles of the ant rather than due
to the natural margin”[]
the above-mentioned insect is a dweller in trees and one might have
supposed that a general resemblance to the leaves among which it moves
would have been a sufficient protection for it this probably was the
beginning of the deception which became more complex as time went on
in the leaf-like back of the insect we see probably the original
disguise but as the eyes of birds became more acute they began to
pierce through it more especially when the creature walked round about
the would-be leaf however the leaf-cutting ants—distasteful to the
birds that so affected it—were constantly moving and walking if only it
could get to resemble one of these it might be as active as it pleased
and especially if its motions as well as its appearance became ant- or
ant and leaf-like and this indeed was what gradually began to take
place variation was always going on and natural selection was always
at hand to mould and shape its results the two insects were to begin
with of much the same size and the general leaf-like appearance of the
one was a good basis on which the more particular resemblance to the cut
piece of leaf carried by the other might be founded a few deeper
washes of brown some not very profound modifications of contour and an
ant-suggesting legs and body began to appear beneath it meanwhile
however hundreds of thousands—nay millions—of bad or mediocre copies
were swept away the species became rarer and rarer—trembled perhaps
on the verge of extinction; but just when it might have appeared to the
birds who were no longer able to obtain a once much-enjoyed morsel
that it really was extinct it was saved; nature’s object had been
gained a certain number of individuals were left were close at hand
even; even now at that very moment one might be crawling on the same
twig where a despondent bird sat only it was not to be distinguished
from a leaf-cutting ant such are the ways of nature such the slaughter
that attends her victories
in borneo and the malay archipelago generally there is a pretty pink
flower known as the “straits rhododendron” once a gentleman was looking
at one of these flowers and admiring it when all at once it turned
round and stared him in the face it was not a flower but a mantis; its
flattened legs—pink like them—made the petals; its abdomen turned up
over the back and held thus motionless resembled an opening bud “when
i held the branch on which the insect had established itself in my hand
i could not tell exactly where animal tissue commenced and where flower
ended so perfectly was the one assimilated to the other both in colour
and surface-texture”[] when once established on a flower this mantis
would remain there quite motionless if undisturbed until it had
occasion to leave it; and of course in nature had any insect settled
on or near it it would have instantly been seized the ways of the
mantis are well known “under a most sanctimonious aspect” says fabre
speaking of the little green one of provence “it hides the morals of a
cannibal”;[] and indeed the female which is larger and stronger
than the male will often turn upon the latter and devour it in the very
midst of a love-passage this it does as in all other cases by
suddenly launching forward one or both of its fore-arms—which have been
previously held in an attitude of prayer—and enclosing the body of the
victim between their first and second segments each of which is toothed
along the edge like a saw the double row of teeth meet in the body
which held aloft and writhing on either side of the trap is devoured
piecemeal by the mantis who with its sharp jaws tears little
mouthfuls out of it as long as it or its appetite lasts this process
made more interesting by the way in which it was brought about was
witnessed in the case of the above-mentioned species small flies
frequently settled upon it as it sat motionless flower-like amidst
flowers “these it made no attempt either to drive off or to capture;
its motions seeming rather to attract than repel them after a short
time a larger _dipteron_ as big as a common house-fly alighted on the
inflorescence within reach of the predatory limbs then the mantis
became active immediately; the fly was seized torn in pieces and
devoured”[] such are the real propensities of the seeming flower and
such too it may be observed are those of some actual flowers—to wit
insectivorous ones
to the malays however whose minds are not yet open to the doctrines of
protective or aggressive resemblance or to evolution generally this
mantis _is_ a flower they “know not seems” the blossoms of “the
_sendudok_” have become alive and perhaps some analogies suggested by
their own life-experience temper their surprise at such an apparent
change of disposition they say too that few men ever see more than
one flower-mantis in the whole course of their lives so rare a creature
is it in this no doubt they are right; yet it would be possible
perhaps even for a malay to see several without knowing anything about
it native eyes are almost always sharper and better than those of the
europeans who come amongst them; but on the other hand no native goes
about like a modern entomologist with his eyes specially open in one
direction and the possibilities of protective resemblance in his mind
the same naturalist during the same expedition was singularly
delighted to secure a larva whose resemblance to a snake was “so
startlingly accurate that i was for a moment completely deceived”[]
a description follows which as it is of that kind which deals longly
and learnedly in details without producing any particular general
effect may be left out it would seem however that this caterpillar
like many others has the power of withdrawing its actual head into a
fold or two of its skin which is here so marked that it performs the
office of a mask obscuring and taking the place of the real head thus
obliterated the mask is furnished with two spots which at once become
the creature’s eyes and both in colour shape and general appearance
bear a remarkable resemblance to those of a snake; whilst a wrinkled
fold running back on either side from what appears to be the snout
suggests the mouth and the flattened head with its characteristic
arrangement of broad flattened scales is also indicated by certain
markings and colours on the required part of the caterpillar’s body an
apparent head like this thrown suddenly up as though threatening to
dart forward with a hiss and distended jaws might alarm anyone and
such a mock demonstration is evidently required to give full effect to
the disguise thus we are told that “when the larva was moving about
with the anterior segments well expanded the resemblance to a snake was
not so startling; but directly it was touched the terrifying attitude
was assumed the anterior segments being drawn in and the front of the
body turned towards the aggressor when at the same time the hinder
part of the body was hidden by leaves the deception became complete and
if effective enough to deceive even temporarily a human being it must
surely be equally effective in deterring less highly organised and timid
foes”
for the “timid” certainly but for the “less highly organised” the
conclusion does not seem so plain no sight is better than a bird’s
and it is practice that makes perfect in any particular direction
still unless we suppose the disguise to be accidental merely—and this
no one with a knowledge of the whole subject can do—the object of it
seems clearly apparent and we may therefore assume that on the
whole it is successful—to the extent at any rate of keeping the
species in existence in such matters however there is nothing like
practical experiments if one has the chance of making them as the
finder of the caterpillar in question must have had since he says
“unfortunately i was unable to test the efficacy of the disguise for
fear of losing the larva which i was anxious to rear for the purpose
of identification”[] to me this appears a false judgment such a
test would have been much more interesting surely especially if
resulting in the way anticipated than a dry pinned specimen and a
latin name
another large snake-resembling caterpillar was found by bates in the
forests of brazil and the likeness was sufficiently striking to alarm
several people to whom he showed it but it is not necessary to go so
far afield for here in england according to professor poulton we have
an excellent example of this kind of protective resemblance this is no
other than the caterpillar of the elephant hawk-moth which by
withdrawing its head into its body—just as does the bornean
species—produces a similar false face with a pair or indeed two
pairs of fierce-looking eyes[] this caterpillar feeds on the great
willow herb and when at rest keeps amongst the dead brown leaves at the
base of the stem “as soon” says professor poulton “as the leaves are
rustled by an approaching enemy the caterpillar swiftly draws its head
and the three first body-rings into the two next rings bearing the
eye-like marks these two rings are thus swollen and look like the head
of the animal upon which four enormous terrible-looking eyes are
prominent the effect is greatly heightened by the suddenness of the
transformation which endows an innocent-looking and inconspicuous
animal with a terrifying and serpent-like appearance”[]
with this caterpillar since naturalists know what to call it and there
is no chance of its handing down any of their names in latin to
posterity it has been possible to make experiments and on the whole
perhaps they have been in favour of the protective resemblance theory
the most interesting one—that i have read that is to say—was made by
professor poulton with a full-sized green lizard and is thus described
by him: “the lizard was evidently suspicious and yet afraid to attack
the caterpillar which maintained the terrifying attitude in the most
complete manner throughout the lizard kept boldly advancing and then
retreating in fright; but at each advance it approached rather nearer to
the caterpillar after this had taken place many times and nothing had
happened the lizard grew bolder and ventured to gently bite what
appeared to be the head of the caterpillar; it then swiftly retired but
finding that there was no retaliation it again advanced and gave it a
rather harder bite after a few bites had been given in this cautious
manner the lizard appeared satisfied that the whole thing was a fraud
and devoured the caterpillar in the ordinary manner”[] professor
poulton has no doubt as to the lizard having been alarmed at first by
the appearance of the caterpillar and adds that he has never seen one
act in the same way on any other occasion; other large hawk-moth
caterpillars being eaten at once with entire _sang-froid_ it may be
observed however that if every lizard were to act in the way recorded
under natural conditions the advantage to the caterpillar would be nil
since though a species may survive through not being eaten it certainly
will not through being eaten with hesitation and why should a lizard be
more timid in the open air than in a box or a fern-case unless we
assume therefore that this particular one was bolder than most others
would be the result of the experiment was not for but against the
theory it was designed to test; and since we have no business to assume
the only thing to do is to get more caterpillars and give them to more
lizards small birds however—and this in a country like england is more
to the point—seem really to fear these pseudo-snakes to the extent of
flying away from them[] but would an ordinary large caterpillar of
the _sphingidæ_—say of a privet hawk or death’s-head moth—frighten them
in the same way if so then again we are nowhere
perhaps a still more extraordinary instance of protective resemblance
than any of the foregoing is that of a caterpillar which pretends to be
an ant—one provided with an efficient sting and of an irritable
disposition here as in the snake cases it is by one portion of the
body only that the fraud is perpetrated but this instead of being the
front is the hind part in which perhaps it offers a unique example
of the sort the colour of the caterpillar is exactly that of the ant
and whilst its extremity represents the latter’s head two black spots
which are there situated bear an equally close resemblance to the eyes
the jaws are represented by the last pair of false legs or claspers
which are of disproportionate size and can upon occasion be stretched
widely apart whilst a number of thin tentacle-like processes attached
in pairs to the segments of the body have all the appearance of an
ant’s legs and antennæ armed with these properties which however in
a state of quiescence are not very recognisable the caterpillar waits
as one may say to have its feelings ruffled when by flinging the
hinder part of its body into the air each separate appurtenance begins
at once to act the part assigned it and the whole becomes a startling
make-up the head with eyes is jerked from side to side the jaws
gape the legs move the antennæ quiver and an angry threatening ant
starts as by magic into being “when” says mr annandale “the
caterpillar is seen in an end-on position or when the anterior
two-thirds of the body are hidden the resemblance is positively
startling” so that “it is difficult to imagine how a lizard or a frog
with a previous experience of the ant could fail to be deterred”[]
in the light of the above cases that of the cuckoo-bees does not seem
so very wonderful since both the species are bees and all or most of
the members of any group or family of animals as a rule bear some
resemblance to one another since they descend from a common and not
very remote ancestor many flies however have almost as close a
resemblance to various bees and wasps whilst one of the latter is even
the model for a species of cricket which would otherwise fall a victim
to it and others of its family there is a beetle too so like a wasp
not only in its appearance but in the way in which it runs about and
moves its antennæ that anyone almost would be taken in whether under
this disguise it enters wasps’ nests and preys upon the larvæ as the
bee-like _volucella_ flies enter the nests of the humble-bees they
imitate i do not know nor i think does anyone but this might very
well be the case these flies however now i come to think of it do
not really injure the bees it used to be the idea that they did but
lately it has been discovered that they are only scavengers feeding on
all the waste products of their hosts and even on their dead bodies
should such opportunities arise[] the humble-bees on their part
seem to appreciate these services though we are not entitled to say
that they admit the flies into their nests on this account since they
probably do so owing to their likeness to themselves
of the walking-stick insects which are hardly to be distinguished even
with close attention from the grass or twigs on which they cling
everyone has heard or read and the caterpillars common enough in
england which remain motionless projecting like a twig from its stem
and looking just the same as one are almost as good instances of
unconscious deception but neither these caterpillars nor any of the
other insects that have been mentioned do anything except through the
attitudes they assume to produce their wonderful disguises they have
nothing to do with the cutting out of the material they do not dress up
for the part themselves that however is what some caterpillars do
there is one for instance in borneo that has a number of spines
arranged in pairs down its back and on each of these spines it fixes
several little buds of the plant on which it is feeding such buds and
not the leaves of the plant being the actual food it eats consequently
the caterpillar which is quite a small one looks like a spray of tiny
buds itself and can hardly by possibility be noticed amidst its
flowery chaplet the buds are not impaled on the spines as might be
supposed but are attached to them with silk which the caterpillar
weaves for the purpose and the whole process of the thing has been
observed by the gentleman who gives the account and who is no less
competent a person than the curator of the sarawak museum this is what
he says: “a bud would be shorn off with the mandibles then held in the
two front pairs of legs and covered all over with silk issuing from the
mouth of the caterpillar the caterpillar then twisted the front part of
its body round and attached with silk the bud to one of the spinous
processes and another bud would then be attached to this and so on
until a sufficiently long string—generally three or four buds—was made
when operations on another spine would be commenced the caterpillar fed
on these buds scooping out the interior and when not hurried using
the empty shells in preference to whole buds for its covering when
irritated it curled up and remained thus for fifteen or twenty minutes
at other times it would sway about looking like a branchlet blown by
the breeze”[]
in time this caterpillar made “a silk cocoon covered with buds” but it
never turned into a butterfly for ants attacked it and its life was
nipped in the bud it appears to be a very rare caterpillar and nobody
knows what butterfly it belongs to or what is its full latin name
since it is a _geometer_ however why not _geometer ignota_ under a
sketch (as given in _nature_ june th ) in the cabinet—which
would in all cases be the better plan
i really do not know whether this or another caterpillar of south
america be the more extraordinary for if the one makes itself like
something the other makes something like itself _anæa_ (_sp_)—i give
the name as i find it—is a little green caterpillar having a very funny
nondescript sort of shape—as much like a little piece of gnawed-out
leaf left hanging to the midrib as anything else such an object
however is not one of the common ones of nature and if it stood alone
might be unrecognised or misinterpreted the caterpillar therefore
feeding along the midrib of the leaf gnaws out a number of such little
pieces more or less like itself and leaves them sticking upright along
it attached by a point or two all the rest of the leaf at that part of
the midrib it apparently eats or bites away so that there remains
only the slender bare stalk with several bits of leaf upon it one of
which is the caterpillar to say which bit is he is now very difficult
and it looks as if none of them were this caterpillar is of course
green like the leaf he feeds on but he is not the same colour all
over he is light above and dark below and this exactly suits—i have it
on authority—the chiaroscuro of the situation so that both in light
and shadow he looks for all the world like a little elongated bit of
green leaf attached to the midrib by a couple of stalks[] one would
say “some caterpillars must have been eating that leaf”; but one would
never think the caterpillar that had been eating it was still there

      butterflies—butterfly doubles—suggested explanation—more
      evidence wanted—warning coloration—a theory on trust—a
      straightforward test—advice to naturalists—a strange
      omission
some of the most remarkable instances of protective resemblances amongst
insects are exhibited by butterflies one perhaps being the most
perfect existing under nature; however i only say perhaps this is the
world-renowned leaf butterfly of sumatra and elsewhere in the malay
archipelago of the great purple emperor family it is purple on the
upper surface and gleams like a meteor as it shoots about in the rich
sun-bathed atmosphere of the tropics its conspicuousness being enhanced
by a sort of miniature sharp-pointed swallow-tail in which the hinder
pair of wings end and a broad orange bar like a sash or scarf of
honour running right across the anterior wings it flies boldly and
strongly and when it descends upon a bush or shrub it is as though a
little purple torch had shot through the foliage; but all at once even
though you see it come down just in front of you it has vanished
utterly—the torch has gone out you may look and look but unless you
know the trick and have seen the settling and never taken your eyes
off the exact spot you will never find the butterfly or see anything
more of it until all at once it gleams in the air again for the under
part of the leaf butterfly’s lovely purple wings is like the leaf
indeed—“the sere the yellow leaf”—with a midrib running down the centre
veinings on either side a curled tip at the top a stalk at the bottom
and everything proper to leaves but not as a rule to butterflies all
four wings join in this effect for being thrown up in the usual way
when the insect settles the leaf-like shape is thus brought about
one-half of the under surface being seen on each side in clear profile
whilst the purple now lies hid within like the pictures on a folded
screen as for the body of the butterfly that is hidden inside the
wings too; the legs are all but invisible and the two little pointed
swallow-tails just touching the plant’s stem with their mutual tip
make the stalk of the leaf even on the wall of a room or a curtain it
would seem as though a dead leaf were sticking there; how much more
when as is always the case the butterfly flies into some bush or
thicket crowded with dry brown leaves and settles all amongst them it
is not that you don’t see it there that makes you miss it but that you
see it and scores of brown leaves all about it every one of which looks
just the same as itself
    the picture at the top shows birds pursuing butterflies while
      in the one below the same birds have lost their prey as the
      butterflies have alighted and show only the underside of
      their wings which are practically indistinguishable from
      the neighbouring leaves
to make the matter plainer in case this is not a very accurate
description here is the account of an eye-witness: “this species” says
dr wallace “was not uncommon in dry woods and thickets and i often
endeavoured to capture it without success for after flying a short
distance it would enter a bush among dry or dead leaves and however
carefully i crept up to the spot i could never discover it till it
would suddenly dart out again and then disappear in a similar place at
length i was fortunate enough to see the exact spot where the butterfly
settled and though i lost sight of it for some time i at length
discovered that it was close before my eyes but that in its position of
repose it so closely resembled a dead leaf attached to a twig as almost
certainly to deceive the eye even when gazing full upon it” then
follows a minute explanation of the imposture “the end of the upper
wings terminates in a fine point just as the leaves of many tropical
shrubs and trees are pointed while the lower wings are somewhat more
obtuse and are lengthened out into a short thick tail between these
two points there runs a dark curved line exactly representing the
midrib of a leaf and from this radiate on each side a few oblique
marks which well imitate the lateral veins the tint of the under
surface varies much but it is always some ashy brown or reddish colour
which matches with those of dead leaves the habit of the species is
always to rest on a twig and among dead or dry leaves and in this
position with the wings closely pressed together their outline is
exactly that of a moderately-sized leaf slightly curved or shrivelled
the tail of the hind wings forms a perfect stalk and touches the stick
while the insect is supported by the middle pair of legs which are not
noticed among the twigs and fibres that surround it the head and
antennæ are drawn back between the wings so as to be quite concealed
and there is a little notch hollowed out at the very base of the wings
which allows the head to be retracted sufficiently all these varied
details combine to produce a disguise that is so complete and marvellous
as to astonish everyone who observes it and the habits of the insect
are such as to utilise all these peculiarities and render them
available in such a manner as to remove all doubt of the purpose of this
singular case of mimicry which is undoubtedly a protection to the
insect its strong and swift flight is sufficient to save it from its
enemies when on the wing but if it were equally conspicuous when at
rest it could not long escape extinction owing to the attacks of the
insectivorous birds and reptiles that abound in the tropical
forests”[]
dr wallace then speaks of another closely allied species which is
common in india on the under surface of whose wings there are
sometimes to the boot of all that has been described in the way of
disguise “patches and spots formed of small black dots so closely
resembling the way in which minute fungi grow on leaves that it is
almost impossible at first not to believe that fungi have grown on the
butterflies themselves”[] the minuteness of a resemblance like this
is really very surprising for it seems as though the butterfly-hunting
bird or insect—some powerful wasp may represent the latter—was capable
of minutely examining the object in question and saying to itself as
it were “i don’t think that can be a leaf because there are no black
spots upon it” or _vice versâ_ in reality however it is no doubt the
general effect to which every detail contributes that tells what such
resemblances do seem to me to show—and this i think is a new idea—is
the accuracy and precision of some insects’ sight how insects see
things has long been a question and many i suppose think it quite
uncertain whether a leaf for instance throws the same picture on their
retina that it does on ours but if to deceive them the copy must be
such that it also deceives us is it not clear that it does otherwise
the effect of the original could probably be reproduced by a less
accurate copy how little after all does the finest painting really
resemble nature! the effect alone does so not the means by which it is
arrived at surely then if an insect looking at a leaf or any other
object received but a general impression of colour with an outline
more or less blurred or ill-defined these copies of nature by
nature—made to deceive—would bear witness to the fact a study of
protective resemblances is perhaps the best way of forming an idea as to
how creatures other than ourselves see the world it is even possible
that such resemblances exist which we because we see things
differently are totally incapable of detecting
i do not know if any other striking case of resemblance to an inanimate
object (if plant life can be included under this term) is offered by the
butterfly world though there are several more of the same kind but i
cannot remember one just now no doubt there are many which have not yet
been discovered we have however various instances of concealment even
here in england as for instance the peacock butterfly; but these as
well as special resemblances are for the most part more marked in
moths the lappet moth indeed though it does not quite get the shape
looks very like a dead brown leaf whilst in the buff-tip moth we are
supposed to have a special resemblance to a piece of rotting wood
clothed with moss or lichen and broken at each end personally i have
never received the impression of such a definite object but only a
general one of rot and decay even here however i do not believe i
could ever be taken in for the yellow head and tips of the wings which
are supposed to offer a perfect resemblance to the two broken ends of
the piece of wood are to me the tell-tale parts and instantly cry out
“moth!” in fact soft as is the colouring of the buff-tip it still
seems to me a salient object and i do not think very much of that
bird’s eyesight who fails to detect it under anything like favourable
circumstances
another moth that flies by day and is not uncommon in the united
states bears when sitting on a leaf a much stronger resemblance to a
bird-dropping but in this not uncommon form of imitation moths and all
other insects are outdone by spiders who use it aggressively against
them and particularly it would seem against butterflies as the
following instances will show mr forbes once whilst travelling in
java saw a butterfly settled upon a bird-dropping he watched it for
some time and then wondering at its long stay approached cautiously
and slowly extending his hand actually caught it by its wings between
his finger and thumb—no mean feat as it seemed yet there was nothing
to boast of as he lifted the butterfly only the wings came away the
rest of it staying with the supposed bird-dropping which was now seen
to be a spider who having caught the butterfly by means of this
shameful imposture was quietly occupied in eating it the disguise in
this case was of the most wonderful perfection “such excreta” says mr
forbes who discovered this one “consist of a central and denser
portion of a pure white chalk-like colour streaked here and there with
black and surrounded by a thin border of the dried-up more fluid
part”[] the appearance of each of these constituent parts was
successfully counterfeited by the spider in question who in its own
person represented the more solid material and spun the rest with its
web
as i know from early experience when a naturalist makes a prize all at
once of some interesting specimen for some time afterwards he expects
or rather feels as if he would see some other on every leaf or twig;
but time went by and no more of these “vain delusive” spiders presented
themselves at length years afterwards the same naturalist found
himself by the banks of the moesi river in sumatra (which sounds much
more interesting than the thames for instance) and this was his second
experience “i was” he says “rather dreamily looking on the shrubs
before me when i became conscious of my eyes resting on a
bird-excreta-marked leaf how strange i thought it is that i have
never got another specimen of that curious spider i found in java which
simulated a patch just like this! i plucked the leaf by the petiole
while so cogitating and looked at it half-listlessly for some moments
mentally remarking how closely that other spider had copied nature
when to my delighted surprise i discovered that i had actually secured
a second specimen but the imitation was so exquisite that i really did
not perceive how matters stood for several moments the spider never
moved while i was plucking or twirling the leaf and it was only when i
placed the tip of my little finger on it that i observed that it was a
spider when it without any displacement of itself flashed its falces
into my flesh”[] (he means it bit him)
not all butterflies are entrapped by the kind of simulacrum here
noticed nature can adapt herself to every taste and in south africa
there are spiders who make themselves attractive by appearing to be
flowers of some of these and their _modus operandi_ mr rowland trimen
who was curator of the cape town museum gives the following interesting
account: “many species of spiders” he says “are well adapted to
succeed by being coloured in resemblance to the flowers in or on which
they await the arrival of their victims one that inhabits cape town is
of the exact rose-red of the flowers of the oleander and to more
effectually conceal it the palpi top of the cephalothorax and four
lateral stripes on the abdomen are white according remarkably with the
irregular white markings so frequent on the petals of _nerium_”[]
these indeed must be beautiful spiders and one would like to hear a
little more of them but mr trimen goes at once from red to yellow “i
was led” he continues “to notice a yellow spider of the same group in
consequence of seeing that two of a number of butterflies on the flowers
of _senecio pulugera_ did not on my approach fly off with their
companions each of these unfortunates turned out to be in the clutches
of a spider and when i released them i observed their captors very
narrowly and i found that the latter’s close resemblance to the
_senecio_ flowers was not one of colour alone but due also to attitude
this spider holding on to the flower stalk by the two hinder pairs of
legs extended the two long front pairs upward and laterally in this
position it was scarcely possible to believe that it was not a flower
seen in profile the rounded abdomen representing the central mass of
florets and the extended legs the ray florets while to complete the
illusion the femora of the front pair of legs adpressed to the thorax
have each a longitudinal red stripe which represents the ferruginous
stripe on the sepals of the flower”[]
later on mr trimen was so fortunate as actually to see a butterfly
caught by another flowery impostor:—“the butterfly” he tells us “was
engaged in honey-sucking on a white flower-head of _lantana_ and
explored each individual flower with its proboscis while i was watching
it the butterfly touched and partly walked over what looked like a
slightly folded or crumpled flower about the middle of the cluster this
turned out to be a spider which instantly seized the butterfly
throwing forward its front legs somewhat after the fashion of a mantis
in this spider the effect of the little depressions on the limb of the
corolla was given by some depressed lines on the back of its smooth
white abdomen”[]
other spiders resemble snail-shells others ants and one at least is
like a small scorpion but we will return to the butterflies as i have
said except for that wonderful copy of a leaf already described i
cannot think of any very extraordinary resemblances amongst them
belonging to that class but there are others which form a little class
of their own in the last chapter we have seen bees imitating bees and
in this we will make the acquaintance of certain butterflies which as
it were pretend to be of a species which they do not really belong to
thus in brazil by the great river amazons a number of large showy
butterflies are found which belong to the family of the _heliconea_ and
wherever these fly they are accompanied by various other butterflies
belonging to quite different families which are nevertheless so
extremely like them that even mr bates who for eleven years ran up
and down the amazons with a butterfly-net in his hand could never be
quite sure which kind it was that he was going to catch often when he
thought he had got a _heliconea_ he was perfectly thunderstruck to find
it was really a _papilio_ _pieris_ _euterpe_ _leptalis_
_protogonius_ _ithoneis_ _dioptis_ _pericopis_ _hyelosia_ or
something of that sort; or again when it was one of these he was after
and at last he thought he had it in the net he would be petrified on
looking more closely to find that what he had really caught was a
_heliconea_
but now as all these butterflies were alike or nearly alike how could
mr bates tell—or how had anybody been able to tell before him—that they
were really not all the same species—that a _heliconea_ was not a
_papilio_ or that a _papilio_ _pieris_ _euterpe_ etc were not all
of them _heliconeas_ this at first sight seems a difficult question
to answer but really it is not because in all these families of
butterflies the various species composing them bear a kind of
generalised resemblance to one another: there is a family likeness in
fact and this is not only the case in regard to their outward
appearance—the shape and colour of their wings etc—but it applies in
a still greater degree to their structure and internal economy thus
however strongly a _pieris_ or one of those others might resemble a
_heliconea_ the trained eye of an entomologist could easily see that it
really was a member of another family and since in resembling the
_heliconea_ it departed from the general type of pattern and colouring
exhibited by the family to which it belonged whilst this one species of
_heliconea_ it resembled was like the others it might be inferred that
the latter was the imitated and not the imitating form again—and this
is still more decisive evidence in the cases where it applies—the
resemblance is often confined to one sex of the copying species viz
the female so that whilst she is hardly to be distinguished from the
model on which she has founded herself the male retains the appearance
together with all the other characteristics of the race to which both
he and she belong
but now came a further question the most puzzling or at any rate the
most important one of all viz why should the one butterfly imitate or
rather resemble the other in such an extraordinary degree—a degree
seeming to preclude the possibility of mere chance having brought it
about this question mr bates is supposed to have been the first to
answer though i cannot help thinking myself that he has only extended
an explanation which in some cases was so obvious that no one had
thought of pointing it out to these other cases where it was not nearly
so easy to see for what can be plainer as mr bates himself remarks
than that a moth for instance by closely resembling a hornet would
escape the attacks of birds that might otherwise have devoured it i
cannot think but that so patent an explanation had been in the minds of
many long before  and though no one previous to that date may have
applied the principle of natural selection to such cases it must be
remembered that natural selection had been established by darwin some
ten or twelve years before
bates however besides making an ingenious application of the above
principle to a special case gave a real reason for something which was
not at all obvious viz why one butterfly should be a gainer by closely
resembling another; and this no one had hitherto been able to do his
surmise which has since in many instances been confirmed is as
follows having first pointed out that the _heliconea_ butterflies are a
numerous flourishing race whilst those species that imitate them are
poor in numbers he says “what advantages the _heliconidæ_ possess to
make them so flourishing a group and consequently the object of so
much mimetic resemblance it is not easy to discover there is nothing
apparent in their structure or habits which could render them safe from
persecution by the numerous insectivorous animals which are constantly
on the watch in the same parts of the forest which they inhabit it is
probable they are unpalatable to insect enemies some of them have
glands near the end of the abdomen which they protrude when roughly
handled; it is well known that similar organs in other families secrete
fetid liquids or gases and that these serve as a protection to the
species they have all a peculiar smell i never saw the flocks of
slow-flying _heliconidæ_ in the woods persecuted by birds or
dragon-flies to which they would have been easy prey; nor when at rest
on leaves did they appear to be molested by lizards or the predaceous
flies which were very often seen pouncing on butterflies of other
families if they owe their flourishing existence to this cause it would
be intelligible why species whose scanty number of individuals reveals a
less protected condition should be disguised in their dress and thus
share their immunity is it not probable seeing the excessive abundance
of the one species and the fewness of individuals of the other that the
_heliconea_ is free from the persecution to which the _leptalis_ is
subjected”[]
no sooner was this suggestion made than naturalists all over the world
began to test it or rather to say that it ought to be tested some
experiments have been made but they have not been very numerous and it
can hardly be said that they entirely support bates’s view sometimes
they do and sometimes they do not so as there is no reason to suppose
that every butterfly is relished by every kind of insect-eating
creature this is not conclusive till the same tests are employed in
regard to butterflies that are not imitated in this way; for if the
latter have not been imitated on that account it need not be on that
account that others have been imitated thus belt says as the result of
his observations “the _heliconidæ_ are distasteful to most animals; i
have seen even spiders drop them out of their webs again; and small
monkeys which are extremely fond of insects will not eat them as i
have proved over and over again”[] he also “observed a pair of birds
that were bringing butterflies and dragon-flies to their young and
although the _heliconidæ_ swarmed in the neighbourhood and are of weak
flight so as to be easily caught the birds never brought one to their
nest”[] this seems very good evidence of the truth of bates’s
theory but then as against it we learn from the same observer that
“another spider that frequented flowers seemed to be fond of these very
same butterflies” and as to the spiders which were seen to drop them
out of their webs they may resolve themselves into one since farther
on belt says “a large species of spider also used to drop them out of
its web when i put them into it”[] then we are told that “there is
however a yellow and black-banded wasp that catches them to store his
nest with”; and which having done so “would quietly bite off its
wings roll it up into a ball and fly off with it”[] professor
poulton calls these cases “interesting exceptions” and easily accounts
for them but might not further observation keep adding to the number of
exceptions until at last they become so numerous that all one could
say would be this: “there is a great choice of insects in tropical
america and some creatures may prefer one kind and some another to
whatever species they belong” in india again where there is another
family of butterflies having doubles or understudies only one species
was refused by all the mantids which a french naturalist gave them to
others were eaten by all of them
has any man tried eating one of these butterflies that was what
professor wheeler did to test another supposed case of the same sort
here the insect was a large and very conspicuously coloured day-flying
moth this moth has not an understudy as far as is known but it was
supposed then to be an example of what is called “warning coloration”
that is to say its bright colours were believed to be flourished in the
face of any and every animal it might meet with in order to warn them
that it was not good to eat otherwise some bird or lizard or other
creature might kill it before it had time to find out that it wasn’t
for instance had it been just a brown moth—there are so many of these
and most of them good to eat—how was it to be distinguished from others
but such a get-up as _that_—black and white wings and a black and orange
body—once seen it was not to be forgotten it was like the red flag at a
rifle range warning one off and this is the theory of warning
coloration so professor wheeler as he rode through the deserts of
wyoming with the moths all about him resolved to test this theory
which had lived for a long time and still goes on living a good deal on
trust “he dismounted from his horse and proceeded to masticate the body
of one of the moths to his astonishment the little flavour that it
contained was mild and pleasant one may almost say nut-like”[]
perhaps it may be thought that on the “_de gustibus_” principle what
is pleasant to a human being might be disagreeable to a bird or a
lizard; but professor wheeler tried another experiment “another
day-flying moth common in our eastern states has deep black wings
each adorned with a pair of large yellow spots and there is a dash of
orange on its legs it certainly cannot be a mimetic species (if it
were of course one would not expect it to be nasty) as there is no
other day-flying moth which could serve as its model several of these
moths were given to some lizards that had previously been well fed on
house-flies and could not therefore be very hungry the moths were
seized at once and devoured with evident signs of relish”[]
as a result of these experiments professor wheeler concludes that
“naturalists should be more careful in imputing nauseous or disagreeable
qualities to some conspicuously coloured animals” and he suggests that
“if every field entomologist could only bring himself to repeat the
writer’s experiment on one of many cases of ‘flaunted nauseousness’ and
place his taste impressions on record we should in the course of time
have a really valuable body of evidence for we can hardly assume that
beasts birds and reptiles can find things ‘nauseous’ which are quite
tasteless or even pleasant to the human palate”[] “_il n’y a pas
de réplique à cela_” and how it is that so simple a plan did not occur
to mr bates during all the eleven years he was on the amazon it is not
very easy to imagine on the whole perhaps it may be said that the
reason why certain butterflies are imitated by other butterflies has not
been so satisfactorily settled as the fact that they are so imitated
but on the other hand there is some—perhaps much—evidence of the truth
of bates’s theory and moreover that theory is in itself so plausible
that it seems to require a good deal of evidence to overthrow it
it is not only in south america that butterflies dress up like one
another instances similar to those here given occur also in africa and
the malay archipelago as well as in other parts of the world there is
even one doubtful case in england both the copy and original being
moths moths especially the day-flying ones are represented in these
phenomena as well as butterflies which are sometimes imitated by them

though the principle of protective resemblance as explained in the last
chapter will account for the colours and markings of those butterflies
which imitate the _heliconidæ_ it does not explain how the _heliconidæ_
themselves came to be as they are; for in nature every mark and line and
shade has a meaning and has come into existence by virtue of some law
or another beauty itself independently of any _arrière pensée_ as we
may call it—remembering those flower-resembling spiders—requires to be
explained
nor are the _heliconidæ_ themselves though gaudily dressed showy
butterflies anything like so beautiful as many others; for instance as
the _morphos_ those giants of their kind who sweep like stars through
the tropical forests on wings whose whole broad surface is blue but a
blue that flashes like a drawn sword and has a hundred glints and
gleamings of ever-varying light high-fliers they are for the most part
keeping to the tops of the trees but every morning and always at the
same time they make a descent into the glades and alleys of the forest
where for a little they flap lazily backwards and forwards now in
eclipse now flashing forth into sunlight as though to flaunt their
beauties in the face of the lower world such openings in the primeval
forest are often made by the fall of great trees—for even where the axe
is not there is death in the midst of life—and as these majestic insects
sail high above them in a world of air and light their shadows fall
upon the place beneath and trace their course along the ground when
the sun’s rays strike into them such clearings become the gathering
grounds of various butterflies besides the great _morphos_ the
flashing of whose wings in the sunlight can be seen sometimes a quarter
of a mile away[] various species of _heliconeas_—the one we have
just been reading about—whose black wings are in some species spotted
with scarlet in others with white or blue waltz about the bushes or
undergrowth “dancing in the chequered shade”; fritillaries somewhat
like our own but of larger size and more effective colouring fly
higher up about the tree-trunks whilst over the ground itself
carpeted as it often is with flowers fallen from the leafy world above
and scenting the air ghost-like butterflies whose clear transparent
wings are without any colouring matter ceaselessly hover and flit
wherever there is a river many-coloured armies bivouacked amidst its
various shoals and reefs sit sucking water through the moist particles
of the sand whilst others in even greater numbers pass and repass
from one bank to another making however wide the waterway an aerial
fluttering bridge other butterflies also denizens of the great
brazilian or central american forests have broad white wings shot with
a satiny lustre whilst those of yet another are like glass with one
opaque spot of violet and blue in the midst of each of them in flight
this spot is the only part that can be seen and it looks bates tells
us “like the wandering petal of a flower”[] there are
swallow-tailed butterflies too whose livery of deep soft green and
deeper velvet black set off with roseate hues is amongst the richest
of all—“rich not gaudy” so at least i should term it for i have seen
it putting flowers to shame on the lower slopes of the himalayas here
these butterflies—double the size of our _machaon_ and of another
shape with racquet-rather than swallow-tails flew on the open
hillside courting the sun but in brazil they keep to the forest
depths where like una they “make a sunshine in the shady place”
the butterflies of south america are almost rivalled—quite they cannot
be—by those of the malay archipelago here we have the great bird-winged
butterfly discovered by dr wallace who calls it “elegant” and
bestows upon it a name (_ornithoptera brookeana_) which is not quite
that[] however “what’s in a name that which we call a
_brookeana_” etc—we must reverse the proposition there is no
describing such a creature—at least not convincingly suffice it to say
that its wings “almost resemble those of a sphinx moth in shape” and
are deep velvety black but lit up with a band of green feather-like
markings so brilliant and lovely that they reminded its discoverer “of
the wing-coverts of the mexican trogon laid upon velvet”[]—and that
for anyone who has seen a trogon even stuffed and dried is to say
enough besides this adornment the great _brookeana_ has “a broad
neck-collar of vivid crimson and a few delicate white touches on the
outer margins of the hind wings”[] another _ornithoptera_ without
the _brookeana_ is “the largest the most perfect and the most
beautiful of butterflies” the two last however are matter of opinion
and i should think myself that a _morpho_ with its azure wings
sometimes seven inches across and flashing a quarter of a mile away
would run—or fly—it hard then there is a yet more gorgeous species of
“bird-winged butterfly” with wings equalling or even exceeding the
_morpho’s_ in expanse whose ample surface is divided between flame-like
orange and a black so deep rich and velvety that it seems to glow—“the
pride of the eastern tropics one of the most gorgeously coloured
butterflies in the world”[]
this was the butterfly that gave dr wallace a headache “so great was
the excitement produced by what will appear to most people a very
inadequate cause”[] surely not; for the cause here alluded to was
not the insect’s beauty—which had been seen before free and
untrammelled without any such ill-consequence—but its capture and
anticipated transference to the cyanide bottle it was not mere æsthetic
emotion therefore that produced the headache but scientific
enthusiasm of which no man need feel ashamed it is easy for us on such
occasions to mistake our feelings but the clue to them i think is
this that however beautiful a creature may be and however appreciative
we may think ourselves of such beauty yet if we resolve in the true
interests of science to take that creature’s life then the scientific
spirit must be far stronger in us than mere admiration of its beauty
this test i would apply to another account which dr wallace gives us of
the capture of “one of the most magnificent insects that the world
contains” “i trembled” he says “with excitement as i saw it coming
majestically towards me and could hardly believe i had really succeeded
in my stroke till i had taken it out of the net and was gazing lost in
admiration at the velvet black and brilliant green of its wings—seven
inches across—its golden body and crimson breast it is true i had seen
similar insects in cabinets at home but it is quite another thing to
capture such oneself—to feel it struggling between one’s fingers and to
gaze upon its fresh and living beauty a bright gem shining out amid the
silent gloom of a dark and tangled forest the village of dobbo held
that evening at least one contented man”[] when we consider that the
“fresh and living beauty” was caught for the very sake of being made
dead and mouldy and that the “bright gem” which would otherwise have
continued to flash in the forest was about to become one of those very
same specimens that had been looked at with such an inferior degree of
interest we must admit i think that the higher of two passions was
predominant here and that the author in dwelling only upon the other
and lower one—mere delight of the eye—has done himself less than
justice
mr bates without headaches has given us some very pleasing pictures
of butterfly-life in the tropics and in doing so he has instinctively
as it were kept the killing and capturing in the background “the
number and variety of gaily-tinted butterflies” he tells us “sporting
about in this grove on sunny days were so great that the bright moving
flakes of colour gave quite a character to the physiognomy of the place
it was impossible to walk far without disturbing flocks of them from the
damp sand at the edge of the water where they congregate to imbibe the
moisture they were of almost all colours sizes and shapes i noticed
here altogether eighty species belonging to twenty-two different genera
it is a singular fact that with very few exceptions all the
individuals of these various species thus sporting in sunny places were
of the male sex; their partners which are much more soberly dressed and
immensely less numerous than the males being confined to the shades of
the woods every afternoon as the sun was getting low i used to notice
these gaudy sunshine-loving swains trooping off to the forest where i
suppose they would find their sweethearts and wives”[] what a
delightful scene! here “next to the very common sulphur-yellow and
orange-coloured kinds the most abundant were about a dozen species of
_eunica_ of large size conspicuous from their liveries of glossy dark
blue and purple a superbly adorned creature the _callithea markii_
having wings of a thick texture coloured sapphire blue and orange was
only an occasional visitor on certain days when the weather was very
calm two small gilded green species literally swarmed on the sands
their glittering wings lying wide open on the flat surface”[]
such then are the colours of butterflies and as may be imagined
comparatively few of these gorgeous liveries have been acquired through
the principle of protective resemblance—using the term in its widest
sense to include those cases where one species becomes as it were the
double or wraith of another mimicry is the word which by a ludicrous
process of false reasoning naturalists have convinced themselves it is
right to apply to this particular kind of resemblance and no other one;
though why a butterfly should _mimic_ another butterfly and only
_resemble_ a leaf “_quien sabe_” as the spaniards say the principal
reason adduced for this misuse of language viz that the wrong word is
more convenient than any right one providing us with the useful series
_mimic_ _mimicry_ _mimetic_ _mimicker_ _mimicked_ _mimicking_
obviously applies to the one case as well as the other and if it is an
advantage to be absurd in one way surely it is a double one to be
absurd in two on these grounds i would suggest to naturalists that
having broken down the proper and natural confinements of the word in
question they should rather extend its use than limit it to the extent
even of calling their children “mimetic forms” should they happen to
resemble them and thinking twice before punishing a son for merely
“mimicking” his father
but leaving this how—to take the jargon as one finds it—are the
glorious colours of butterflies to be explained when they are due
neither to protective resemblance which is not mimicry though it very
much resembles it nor to mimicry which is distinct from protective
resemblance though mimicking it exactly certainly neither of these
will do to account for uncopied hues and patterns which are like
nothing in the world but their own loveliness unless indeed it be the
rival glories of the most resplendent birds still less will aggressive
resemblance—though as we see it can make spiders look like
flowers—explain them the great governing cause which produces such
effects as these as well as most others in nature is natural
selection; but we must look beyond natural selection even if we wish to
understand all the beauty that we see in the animal world and
especially the higher developments of it
darwin as we know was the great demonstrator—though not the first
conceiver—of the law of natural selection[] and on this he might
have cried “_nunc dimittis_” and retired so to speak leaving someone
else to find out the other law; but instead of that he went on and
demonstrated that too this other law the evidence for which is really
overwhelming and has never been met by anything better than a conceited
over-estimation of human superiority wrapped up in a cloud of wrong
reasoning is that of sexual selection which implies that in the
choice of their mates animals like ourselves are guided by some sort
of preference; and as this with them—again like ourselves—is usually
determined by the element of beauty the most beautiful partners are
being constantly selected and species in consequence become more and
more beautiful this process however is usually confined to the males
they being the eager wooers whilst the females only wait to be courted
and then shyly and modestly choose—such at least is the supposition
this masculine beauty is often inherited by that sex only to which it is
so useful but in other cases it is transmitted to the female also
thus to take birds where the results of the law of sexual selection
are on the whole most pronounced we have on the one hand the
pheasants and birds of paradise where the male alone is resplendent
whilst in the trogons parrots and many other species the beauty is
common to both the sexes as is well known the males of various highly
ornate birds are accustomed to make the most extraordinary display of
their beauty before the females making the most of the parts most
richly decorated assuming just such attitudes as are required in order
to give these their full advantage and in fact taking pains and
trouble in a high degree and of a very special and peculiar kind which
must either be directed to an end which seems perfectly plain and
apparent or else so much waste of time—due to no special cause and
without any particular meaning—an alternative which the opponents of
sexual selection do not in the least mind accepting
to give one instance of what is called nuptial display in birds—for it
will serve to illustrate what darwin supposes to take place with some
insects also as well as forming a basis of comparison with what has
been more carefully observed in the case of spiders—belt in his often
quoted work gives us the following pretty picture of humming-bird
courtship speaking of a beautiful blue green and white species
(_florisuga mellivora_) he says: “i have seen the female sitting
quietly on a branch and two males displaying their charms in front of
her one would shoot up like a rocket then suddenly expanding the
snow-white tail like an inverted parachute slowly descend in front of
her turning round gradually to show off both back and front the effect
was heightened by the wings being invisible from a distance of a few
yards both from their great velocity of movement and from not having
the metallic lustre of the rest of the body the expanded white tail
covered more space than all the rest of the bird and was evidently the
grand feature in the performance whilst one was descending the other
would shoot up and come slowly down expanded the entertainment would
end in a fight between the two performers; but whether the most
beautiful or the most pugnacious was the accepted suitor i know
not”[]
here the display as well as the intention seems evident enough and it
is not a whit more so than in hundreds of other cases collected by
darwin during his lifetime and which have been largely added to since
his death as the hen is constantly present during these performances
and as she has been known on various occasions to show a strong
partiality or the reverse to this or that male bird we have here a
solid basis of observed fact on which to raise an hypothesis on what
facts the counter one rests as propounded by dr wallace viz that
colour and antics are produced by superior vigour resident in the male
it is less easy to see unless indeed such as point in a quite
opposite direction may on a sort of _lucus a non lucendo_ principle be
held to support it if this be conceded then indeed we have a
plentiful crop nor need we any longer feel sceptical because the eagle
say—that bird of fierce energy—does not flash out like all the crown
jewels together as it descends on its prey or because the swift whose
vital force is perhaps even greater leaves no train of jewelled light
to die all day behind it on the air nor need we wonder that the
trogons though as resplendent as the swifts swallows[] and eagles
are dull-coloured should be as lazy and sluggish as these are
energetic: nor that whereas the females of some humming-birds are
sober-suited those of others though their vigour would seem to be in
no way superior are as gem-like as their mates: or that the males as
well as the females of some wholly dull-coloured ones and of many other
plain birds seem bursting with vigour and indulge in all sorts of
strange antics and dances: that a cock partridge for instance seems as
vigorous as a cock pheasant and that bright colours and pugnacity are
dissociated in such tremendous fighters as the ruff the coot and the
blackcock multiply such instances by the score or the hundred—as can
easily be done—and if only the above-stated principle be granted we get
more and more proof of the correctness of a theory to which facts if
dealt with in the more usual way would be almost instantly fatal after
all this would be a more satisfactory mode of procedure than that of
tolerating a travesty on the strength of a high reputation there is
such a principle in nature as the _lucus a non lucendo_ one so as we
admit the word mimicry in a false sense—because it is convenient—why not
admit that it would be not one whit less convenient—for the theory
but handling facts in another way can we explain the beautiful colours
of butterflies as we explain the brilliant plumage of birds—by sexual
selection that is to say of this there is not so much direct evidence
as could be wished for butterfly courtship is a long affair and for
various reasons is not so easy to watch under natural conditions as in
the case of birds though this too is often beset with difficulties
we know however that the male is often much more beautiful than the
female that he pirouettes around her and that she remains often “icy
insensible”—in fact refuses him—which certainly implies a power of
choice rival males too will “whirl round each other with the greatest
rapidity and appear to be incited by the greatest ferocity”[] that
butterflies like bees perceive and are attracted by colours is well
known and it would be strange indeed if they were not alive to the
many very beautiful and complex patterns on their own wings when these
cannot have been evolved through any principle of protection—since they
resemble or suggest nothing—when in fact if not beauty it is
difficult to see the object aimed at yet the strange suggestion has
been made that though butterflies see colours they cannot see form
that their sight is defective in some peculiar kind of way but if form
is outline—and if not what is it—where is the distinction seeing that
the beginning and leaving off of a colour or of two or more colours must
make an outline and therefore a form if we see the colours of a
pattern where the one ends and the other begins we see that pattern
and on the other hand if we could not distinguish one colour from
another or colour from something uncoloured—as say the air—we should
be blind to colour as well as to form form can hardly be called a
thing of itself it is rather the line of demarcation between two or
more things so that if each of these is clearly perceived the form or
outline which their juxtaposition makes must be also perceived assuming
that butterflies see the beautiful arrangements of colour—eyes spots
bands lines etc—in such a way as can alone account for their being
there to see—as well as we do that is to say—then it is absurd to
imagine that they have no perception of form
on what is this assertion based mr scudder relies on the following
facts: “christy” he tells us “observed in manitoba one of the
swallow-tails fluttering over the bushes evidently in search of
flowers as he watched it it settled momentarily and exactly as if it
had mistaken it for a yellow flower on a twig of _betula glandulosa_
bearing withered leaves of a bright yellow colour”[] but might not
the association of ideas raised by a familiar colour in an insect’s mind
overpower for a moment its judgment might it not do so in the case of a
man also and should we think a person very stupid who for a moment
mistaking a yellow leaf for a yellow flower stretched out his hand to
pick it pooh! once again[] let us think of people who do foolish
things—kings generals cabinet ministers servant-maids etc—not of
infallible persons we should not be too severe—not “break a butterfly
on a wheel”
again—this is mr scudder’s second instance: “albert müller records
seeing the blue alexis of europe fly towards a very small bit of pale
blue paper lying upon the grass and stop within an inch or two of it
as if to settle doubtless mistaking it for another of its own
kind”[] surely this is rather in favour of the butterfly’s sight
than otherwise since it discovered its mistake and did not settle who
too can tell the precise moment at which the mistake was discovered
since the piece of blue paper might have puzzled the butterfly—piqued
its curiosity to know what it was—even after it knew what it was not
thirdly “plateau has observed the small tortoise-shell butterfly fly
rapidly towards a cluster of artificial flowers”[] and who cannot be
taken in by artificial flowers “such examples as these” says mr
scudder “seem to indicate that butterflies may perceive colour in mass
but in no case indicate any further visual powers”[] to me they
indicate that butterflies can make mistakes mistakes rarely show one’s
perfections but other indications of further visual powers are not
wanting for instance mr scudder himself says: “one of my favourite
modes of showing this characteristic (inquisitiveness) to unbelieving
friends has been to toss my cap high in the air when these butterflies
will often dart dash at and play around it as it begins again to
descend”[] how do they play around this moving object in the air if
it represents to them only “colour in mass” and not a defined shape and
outline were it otherwise they would fly right into it and be carried
down with it sometimes on top of them but if they see all parts of the
colour so that they can nicely avoid it and sport about its periphery
then they see the shape of the cap then again mr scudder tells us:
“many kinds are of a lively and even pugnacious disposition and perch
themselves upon the tip of a twig or on a stone or some such outlook
and dash at the first butterfly that passes _especially if it be one of
their own species_;[] then the two advance and retreat forwards and
backwards time and again circle round each other with amazing
celerity all the while perchance mounting skywards until suddenly
they part dash to the ground and the now quiet pursuer again stations
himself on the very spot he quitted for the fray”[] how does he do
_that_ without accurate eyesight with good defining power—to which
indeed the whole performance bears witness elsewhere too this
pronounced characteristic of returning to the exact spot left some
little time ago is dwelt upon to me it seems a complete upsettal of
the defective eyesight theory or since good eyesight could do no more
what does such defectiveness matter
the following description also which bates gives us of butterfly-life
by the amazons does not suggest that any of these bright-day-lovers
these children of the sun need write an “_apologia pro oculis suis_”
“the fine showy _heliconii_” he says “often assemble in small parties
or by twos and threes apparently to sport together or perform a kind of
dance” (my “dancing in the chequered shade” therefore was no inapt
quotation) “i believe the parties are composed chiefly of males the
sport begins generally between a single pair they advance retire
glide right and left in face of each other wheel round to a
considerable distance again approach and so on; a third joins in then
a fourth or more _they never touch_;[] when too many are
congregated a general flutter takes place and they all fly off to fall
in again by pairs shortly afterwards”[] lastly belt tells us this:
“here a large spider built strong yellow silken webs joined one on to
the other so as to make a complete curtain of web in which were
entangled many large butterflies generally forest species caught when
flying across the clearing i was at first surprised to find that the
kinds that frequent open places were not caught although they abounded
on low white-flowered shrubs close to the webs; but on getting behind
them and trying to frighten them within the silken curtain their
instinct taught them to avoid it for although startled they threaded
their way through open spaces and between the webs with the greatest
ease”[] if a butterfly with defective eyesight can thread its way
between spiders’ webs so as never to be caught “with the greatest
ease” “why then say an old man can do somewhat”—but it must be
without spectacles
  in  dr wells first amongst the moderns conceived or at least
  formulated in writing the idea of natural selection; but aristotle
  as is usual in such cases had anticipated him as well as darwin
  wallace and one or two others and that in a very unmistakable
  sentence (see footnote on first page of the “historical sketch” in
  _the origin of species_) it would seem however that no one of these
  conceptions was influenced by any previous one of sexual selection
  darwin seems to have been the discoverer as well as in the opinion of
  many the demonstrator

    beautiful spiders—the “peckham paper”—spider courtship—male
      antics and love-dances—occasional accidents—strength of the
      evidence—the one explanation—darwin’s last words—his theory
      established
spiders as we have seen may attain beauty by getting more and more
like flowers but beauty is not the attribute with which they are
principally connected in our minds rather they are a synonym of
something uncouth and horrid-looking as well as of skill and
persevering industry for those of us however who have lived in the
tropics they have other associations for here side by side with the
most hideous of monsters huge dark and hairy are found others small
and gem-like flashing indeed with beauty the representatives in their
order of the humming-birds those “living sunbeams” of the indians
amongst birds these lovely little spiders belong to a particular
family the _attidæ_ which has been placed by common consent at the
head of all the others since whilst structurally and in other
respects it is inferior to none “it contains among its  species
the greatest amount of sexual differentiation and the highest
development of ornamentation” dr wallace after noticing “their
immense numbers variety and beauty” in tropical south america says
“many of them are so exquisitely coloured as to resemble jewels rather
than spiders”;[] and again in his work on the malay archipelago he
alludes to them as “perfect gems of beauty”[]
these little radiant spiders live amongst flowers and foliage and here
they chase such small insects as their size allows them to cope with
besides running they make little leaps into the air and so if they
can manage it come down on their prey for which reason they are often
called “jumping spiders” this is a very different mode of action from
that of remaining perfectly still till a butterfly or other insect
happens to settle on one and it is accordingly instructive to find
that great as is the beauty of these flower-haunting spiders yet it
does not resemble that of the flowers amongst which it is displayed the
iridescent flashes and sparkles more resemble those of the mineral than
of the vegetable world—where indeed they hardly exist—and must serve
as well as their active movements to point them out to their enemies
even amidst a background of flowers it is not upon principles of
protection therefore or to acquire a dissembling resemblance that such
bright brilliancy has been developed in these little creatures
since therefore these spiders could not have become beautiful on any
principle of protective or aggressive resemblance nor yet of warning
coloration for which there would here be no opening and had yet become
beautiful in a high degree they seemed to professor and mrs peckham to
offer a good subject for the testing of the theory of sexual selection
and deciding as to whether darwin or wallace was right in that matter
after several months of careful and often very laborious
observation—rewarded however by the most interesting results—they have
given their answer and this answer resting as it does on the most
irrefragable evidence should be decisive for all time it may safely be
asserted that anyone who after reading the “peckham paper” as it may
well be called is not convinced both that the male spiders of this
beautiful family woo the females by displaying their beauty before them
and that the females carefully watch the display accepting only such as
please them sufficiently and rejecting the others never will be
convinced since only by the spiders actually speaking which is not
likely to happen could the evidence be bettered if indeed the female
had been heard to say “pretty i’ faith” or “you are a fine young man”
just before her actions gave clear or still clearer indication that
this was in her mind had she murmured “take me” as she let herself be
taken and had the male asked after the way common in novels “was it
my abdomen or the stripes on my palpi that made you first fall in love
with me” then perhaps even those who believe that the higher
spiritual love is for man alone would have been converted—and yet i know
not since assertions so unlikely in themselves might have flung doubt
on the whole paper
but however this may be the evidence now offered us in favour of
darwin’s views can never be strengthened except in this way so that as
far as proof is possible in such a matter sexual selection as a law and
principal agent of beauty in nature is now proved though at the same
time several more facts are added to those upon which the counter
hypothesis seems based and which would certainly prove it in
topsy-turvydom to take these first the authors of the paper in
question have sought to apply to spiders “the hypothesis that the
brighter colour of the male is due to his greater activity and vital
force” “beginning” they say “with the most brilliant family—the
_attidæ_—we find that the females are with few exceptions larger
stronger and more pugnacious than the males thus we placed two females
of _phidippus morsitans_ together in a glass jar no sooner did they
observe each other than both prepared for battle eyeing each other with
a firm glance they slowly advanced and in a moment were locked in
deadly combat within a few seconds the cephalothorax of one was pierced
by the fang of the other and with a convulsive tremor it relaxed its
hold and fell dead we placed together eight pairs in all and in each
instance the fight was short and even to the death subsequently we put
in a well-developed male which though smaller was compactly built and
apparently strong enough to bring the virago to terms but to our
surprise he seemed alarmed and retreated trying to avoid her she
however followed him up and finally killed him”[]
so much for _phidippus morsitans_ coming to _dendryphantes elegans_
the authors who kept a number together in a large box “were much
struck by the greater quarrelsomeness of the females they would
frequently go out of their way to chase each other and they were much
more circumspect in approaching each other than were the males”[]
again they say “valkenaer menge hentz and others give numerous
instances where the male meets his death through the fierceness of his
mate in fact the danger is so imminent that after a successful
courtship it is the habit in several genera (eg _epeira_ and
_tegnaria_) for the male to retire with precipitation from the web of
the female as a reasonable precaution; yet the rule is for the male to
be more ‘beautified’ than the female”[]
coming now to the actual courtship of these brilliant spiders the
authors placed pairs of several species in square wooden boxes having a
cloth bottom on which they could easily move about one of the species
experimented on was _dendryphantes elegans_ mentioned only a moment
ago—such a name is not to be forgotten—whose beauty is thus described:
“the male is covered with iridescent scales his general colour being
green in the female the colouring is dark but iridescent and in
certain lights has lovely rosy tints in the sunlight both shine with
the metallic splendour of humming-birds the male alone has a
superciliary fringe of hairs on either side of his head his first legs
being also larger and more adorned than those of his mate”[]
yet the extra vigour from which this special growth is supposed to have
sprung has not as we shall see affected his growth in general “the
female is much larger and her loveliness is accompanied by an extreme
irritability of temper which the male seems to regard as a constant
menace to his safety; but his eagerness being great and his manner
devoted and tender he gradually overcomes her opposition her change of
mood is only brought about after much patient courting on his
part”[] and now comes the minutely interesting description of this
iridescent _couleur de rose_ courtship “while from three to five
inches distant from her he begins to wave his plumy legs in a way that
reminds one of a windmill she eyes him fiercely and he keeps at the
proper distance for a long time if he comes close she dashes at him and
he quickly retreats sometimes he becomes bolder and when within an
inch pauses with the first legs outstretched before him not raised as
is common in other species; the palpi also (in insects it would be the
antennæ) are held stiffly out in front with the points together again
she drives him off and so the play continues now the male grows
excited as he approaches her and while still several inches away
whirls completely around and around; pausing he runs closer and begins
to make his abdomen quiver as he stands on tiptoe in front of her
prancing from side to side he grows bolder and bolder while she seems
less fierce and yielding to the excitement lifts up her magnificently
coloured abdomen holding it at one time vertically and at another
sideways to him she no longer rushes at him but retreats a little as
he approaches at last he comes close to her lying flat with his first
legs stretched out and quivering with the tips of his front legs he
gently pats her; this seems to arouse the old demon of resistance and
she drives him back again and again he pats her with a caressing
movement gradually creeping nearer and nearer which she now permits
without resistance”[] and so on
               “till the happy ‘yes’ falters from her mouth”
almost as exciting though not quite so detailed as the climax scene of
a latter-day novel
[illustration:  a solitary spider dancing before its mate]
[illustration:  a cockroach attacking an astonished scorpion its
weapons are the spines on its powerful hind legs]
of the courtship of another species—_habrocestum splendens_—we have the
following account: “the male a magnificent fellow when we first caught
him displayed for a long time before the female he began by advancing
a few inches before her and then backing off again this being repeated
many times after a while he settled down under a little web in the
corner the female troubled by this indifferent treatment advanced
towards him; he came out and she fell back this play was kept up for
some time but at length the male began his courting in earnest when
within a few inches of her he began a rapid dance from side to side
raising the whole body high on the tips of the legs the first pair
being directed forward and the palpi clasped together with the abdomen
turned to one side and lifted up after a short dance he stood
motionless striking an attitude and remaining quiet for half a minute
then he turned his back on her moving irregularly about with his legs
forward and his palpi vibrating again he dances sideways before her
strutting and showing off like a peacock or whirling around and
around”[]
on such occasions the female would “commonly move nearer to him and
appear much excited herself we at first supposed that this turning
around was accidental but it happened so regularly at a certain stage
of the courtship that we concluded it was an important part of the
display serving to better show off his brilliant abdomen”[] of this
there can hardly be a doubt since on every occasion the male spider
whatever his species assumed such attitudes as displayed his best
points to the best advantage—a fact which recalls the following passage
in one of darwin’s letters: “i am very glad to hear of your cases of the
two sets of _hesperiadæ_ (a butterfly) which display their wings
differently according to which surface is coloured i cannot believe
that such display is accidental or purposeless”
how glad and more than glad would darwin have been to have read the
tale of these spiders! it is indeed one of those ironies of fate of
which the world is so full that he did not live to see this
demonstration—for it is no less—of the truth of his most original and
elevating views; elevating they may be well called since they allow to
the animal world an æsthetic faculty the power once thought
exclusively human of appreciating beauty it is curious how willing
many are to exalt humanity at the expense of all other beings the
higher faculties they like and perception of the beautiful they like
and spirituality—especially in love—they like very much indeed; but they
only like these things in their own species that is to say conceit
lies at the bottom of all this exaltation such man-worshippers would
not have more of a good thing in the world but less so that they may
have all there is of it on such grounds the war against evolution was
waged and its last struggles are against sexual selection the body has
been given up but the spirit which touches us yet more nearly is
still fiercely defended
in _hasarius hoyi_ “the sexes are very different the male being the
more conspicuous of the two in his dances the male has several
movements most commonly he goes from side to side with his first legs
obliquely up at other times he twists the abdomen to one side and
bending low on the other goes first in one direction for about two
inches and then reversing circles to the opposite point the females
are very savage especially with each other and even the members of the
sterner sex are not always free from danger when paying their
preparatory addresses once we saw a female eagerly watching a prancing
male and as he slowly approached her she raised her legs as if to
strike him but he nothing daunted by her unkindly reception of his
attentions advanced even nearer when she seized him and seemed to hold
him by the head for a minute—he struggling at last he freed himself and
ran away”[] yet “this same male after a time courted her
successfully” that so much savagery has to be overcome in the female
and finally is overcome by these dances shows how powerfully she must
be affected by them of another and previously undescribed species “a
dozen or more males and about half as many females” were found by the
authors “assembled together” under natural conditions “the males were
rushing hither and thither dancing opposite now one female and now
another often two males met each other when a short passage of arms
followed the males were very quarrelsome and had frequent fights but
we never found that they were injured indeed after having watched
hundreds of seemingly terrible battles between the males of this and
other species the conclusion has been forced upon us that they are all
sham affairs gotten up for the purpose of displaying before the
females who commonly stand by interested spectators”[]
then there is a small ant-like species who “unlike most of the _attid_
males keeps all his feet on the ground during his courtship raising
himself on the tips of the posterior six he slightly inclines his head
downwards by bending his front legs their convex surface being always
turned forward his abdomen is lifted vertically so that it is at a
right angle to the rest of his body in this position he sways from side
to side after a moment he drops the abdomen runs a few steps nearer
the female and then tips his body and begins to sway again now he runs
in one direction now in another pausing every few moments to rock from
side to side and to bend his brilliant legs so that she may look full
at them”[] what can be clearer than this and here indeed the
authors remark: “we were much impressed by the fact that the attitude
taken by the males served perfectly to show off their fine points to the
female we had never known the male of this species until the day that
we caught this one and put him into the mating-box and it was while
studying his courtship that we noticed how he differed from the female
in his iridescent first legs he could not have chosen a better position
than the one he took to make a display”[]
elsewhere in another experiment with the same species the authors
after remarking that if these specially modified front legs were held in
any other way the effect of the flattened and iridescent surface would
be lost go on to say: “this is a good example of what we have again and
again observed in the courtship of the _attidæ_: that whatever fine
points of colour or structure the male possesses his actions before the
female display them to the very best advantage in whatever part the
special merit may lie he sedulously strives to bring it to the notice
and impress its beauty upon the mind of the female to whom he is paying
his addresses”[] as for the female she is throughout described as
watching the male eagerly and with the greatest interest and that this
interest is not always felt from the first but is aroused by degrees
becoming at last so strong as to suspend for a time the natural
inclination to assault and eat the wooer is all the more significant
that there are dangers in these courtships there has been some
indication “but worse remains behind” _phidippus rufus_ was caught
once and eaten in an unguarded moment and whilst _phidippus morsitans_
was waving his particularly handsome first pair of legs “thickly
adorned with white hairs” precisely the same thing happened to him
still on the whole such incidents are exceptional
particularly interesting is the account given of the courtship of
_saitis pulex_ a male of which species was introduced into a box
already occupied by a female “he saw her as she stood perfectly still
twelve inches away; the glance seemed to excite him and he moved
towards her; when some four inches from her he stood still and then
began the most remarkable performances that an amorous male could offer
to an admiring female she eyed him eagerly changing her position from
time to time so that he might be always in view he raising his whole
body on one side by straightening out the legs and lowering it on the
other by folding the first two pairs of legs up and under leant so far
over as to be in danger of losing his balance which he only maintained
by sidling rapidly towards the lowered side the palpus too on this
side was turned back to correspond to the direction of the legs nearest
it he moved in a semicircle for about two inches and then instantly
reversed the position of the legs and circled in the opposite direction
gradually approaching nearer and nearer to the female now she dashes
towards him while he raising his first pair of legs extends them
upward and forward as if to hold her off but withal slowly retreats
again and again he circles from side to side she gazing towards him in
a softer mood evidently admiring the grace of his antics this is
repeated until we have counted one hundred and eleven circles made by
the ardent little male now he approaches nearer and nearer and when
almost within reach whirls madly around and around her she joining and
whirling with him in a giddy maze again he falls back and resumes his
semicircular motions with his body tilted over; she all excitement
lowers her head and raises her body so that it is almost vertical; both
draw nearer”[]—and the male now for some short period is in no
danger of being eaten
lastly—for this must be the last example—we have a species—_astia
vittata_—in which the male is represented by two differing forms each
of which dances before the female in its own particular way one of
these forms is red like the female which he resembles in other
respects so that this must be taken as the original specific type the
other which has evidently been developed from it in deference to the
æsthetic preferences of the female is black with the special adornment
of three tufts of hair on his head or thereabouts that part of a
spider which is termed the cephalothorax these tufts stick bolt
upright rising together but separating about half-way up and give to
their fortunate possessor—for as we shall see he is fortunate—a very
spruce and dapper appearance looked at dispassionately if one can do
that they are certainly as handsome as moustaches and there is no
reason in the nature of things why they should not be admired as much
so indeed they are and that the admiration bestowed upon each is of
an equally high nature i at any rate see no reason to doubt
the following description will show what a spider with moustaches can
achieve: “the _vittata_ form which is quite like the female when he
approaches her raises his first legs either so that they point forward
or upward keeping his palpi stiffly outstretched while the tip of his
abdomen is bent to the ground this position he commonly takes when
three or four inches away while he retains this attitude he keeps
curving and waving his legs in a very curious manner frequently he
raises only one of the legs of the first pair running all the time from
side to side as he draws nearer to the female he lowers his body to the
ground and dropping his legs also places the two anterior pairs so
that the tips touch in front the proximal joints being turned almost at
a right angle to the body now he glides in a semicircle before the
female sometimes advancing sometimes receding until at last she
accepts his addresses the _niger_ form evidently a later development
is much the more lively of the two and whenever the two varieties were
seen to compete for a female the black one was successful”[]
here surely is a final answer to those assertions as to indifference
on the part of the female which though made in the teeth of
probability are often on account of the difficulties of observation
almost impossible to disprove here are two kinds of males one lively
and with moustaches the other not so lively and without them; as the
first is always or even say generally chosen his appearance must be
preferred were it only his liveliness as dr wallace has suggested
why should he have acquired another dress as well as another dance or
if the female can have a choice as between liveliness and slowness as
between a jig and a minuet why in heaven’s name should she not have
one as between one get-up and another sexual selection might i think
be put to the test in this one species with its two male forms let but
a sufficient number of courtships be observed and reported on and if
_niger_ in a large percentage of them wins the day choice on the part
of the female—the only link in the chain of evidence which it is at all
possible to deny—is a proved thing
but to continue: “he—_niger_—is bolder in his manners (no wonder he
prevails) and we have never seen him assume the prone position as the
red form did when close to the female he always held one or both of
the first legs high in the air waving them wildly to and fro; or when
the female became excited he stood perfectly motionless before her
sometimes for a whole minute seeming to fascinate her by the power of
his glance”[]—greatly aided probably by the three tufts of hair
showing through the archway of the uplifted legs here again too as
in some of the other species—perhaps all—“although the males were
continually waving their first legs at each other their quarrels were
harmless it was quite otherwise with the females since they not only
kept the other sex in awe of them but not infrequently in their battles
killed each other”[] as the males cannot win the females by
fighting what have they to contend with effectively except these
curious elaborate and most interesting displays the purpose of which
is so excessively obvious on the other hand the fact that the females
yield almost against their nature to these displays that they are
slowly and gradually won through their means is proof positive that
they like them and if so how is it possible that they should not like
one more or less than another what in fact is choice but a greater or
less reaction to this stimulus or to that the initial absurdity of
laying claim to a monopoly of such a capacity as this either in our
matrimonial affairs or any other matter in which animals participate
has not been sufficiently dwelt upon
professor poulton in considering this case of _astra vittata_ with its
two male forms one of which is always chosen by the female in
preference to the other remarks (with his own italics) “it must be
admitted that these facts afford the _strongest support_ to the theory
of sexual selection”[] he thus endorses—as anyone i think not
hard-set the other way must endorse—the opinion of the authors of the
paper that “in the _attidæ_ we have conclusive evidence that the females
pay close attention to the love dances of the males and also that they
have not only the power but the will to exercise a choice among the
suitors for their favour”[] to which he adds this rider:
“remembering that this conclusion has only been reached in the _attidæ_
by the closest study i think we may safely explain the smaller
confidence with which we can speak of other animals by the want of
sufficiently careful and systematic investigation”
the process of the narrative having led in the last chapter or two to
a discussion of some of the ways in which insects become shaped and
coloured through natural selection sexual selection seemed marked out
as the subject for this one the reason why i have filled it with
extracts from a certain very interesting paper has been a better one
than that of saving myself trouble that paper—the most important one
perhaps that has ever been written on the subject—is a wonderful
confirmation of darwin’s views but darwin as it appears to me has not
benefited by it in the way that he ought to do in the popular mind
there is no work that i know of written upon merely popular lines that
brings these facts forward and yet i feel sure that to large numbers of
people who yet do not care to read books avowedly scientific they must
be extremely interesting not only in themselves but as allowing them
both to form a judgment on the subject and on the correctness or
otherwise of darwin’s views—for darwin is an interesting and picturesque
figure far beyond the close borough of science
now the general more intelligent public who read perhaps widely but
not very deeply or very specially know that darwin believed in two
forces—natural and sexual selection—by the joint action of which
species as he held had been gradually modified and evolved and they
know that the former of these two has been accepted by science but that
to the latter there has been much more opposition and that it is not—or
is not supposed to be—established like the other many perhaps may
have read dr wallace’s _darwinism_ a work in which darwin’s most
distinctive and original view—that one whose conception apparently he
shared with nobody and on which he based much of the argument contained
in his _descent of man_—is considered and rejected in a way which makes
the title of the book misleading surely if not a somewhat comically
ludicrous misnomer all those who have read it as well as many who have
not will be interested—they cannot fail to be—in the wonderful record
of spider courtships contained in these extracts and having reflected
on them they will if i mistake not be much more impressed with the
arguments _for_ this part of darwinism than they were with those brought
against it in the book of that name
all these latter arguments by the way—the languor of swallows as
against the vitality of parrots trogons etc—were well known to darwin
himself; and as no one was at the same time more impartial in
considering and more capable of correctly estimating facts hostile to
his own theories or which at first sight might seem to be so it may
not be out of place to end this chapter with a reference to what he
thought of them this we may gather from a statement contained in a
paper—the last presumably ever written by him—which was read before
the zoological society but a few hours before his death and which is as
follows: “i may perhaps be here permitted to say that after having
carefully weighed to the best of my ability the various arguments
which have been advanced against the principle of sexual selection i
remain firmly convinced of its truth”

      spider—alternative explanation—the dangers of
      patriotism—trap-door spiders—web-flying spiders—spiders that

none of the spiders mentioned in the last chapter are web-makers these
latter are not dancers; that is to say the males do not dance before
the females when they wish to recommend themselves as husbands instead
they pull at the strands of the web whilst stationed at its
circumference in a manner which has a distinct meaning for the female
who sits in the centre and who replies by other twitches these may be
either of an encouraging or repellent nature and it is only in the
former case that the lover ventures to approach this however he must
do with extreme caution and prepared at any moment to drop and hang
suspended by a thread should the object of his attentions who greatly
exceeds him in size change her mind or conceive some cause of
displeasure against him should he not be sufficiently quick on such
occasions he is liable to be spun up between the long legs of his
lady-love as though he were a fly and disposed of accordingly this was
observed in  by raymond maria de termayer who remarks upon it:
“perhaps overpowering hunger compelled her to do it but the act was
very ferocious”
the most curious thing in these _webepathic_ courtships as one may call
them is that the female spider seems to know the particular jerk or
twitch of any strand of the web which is made by a male and to
distinguish it perfectly from the vibrations set in motion by a fly or
other insect that enters it for upon these occasions though her back
may be turned towards her admirer she does not trouble to look round
whereas in the latter case she would not only do so but come rushing
down to secure her victim—if she were hungry perhaps it should be
added on the other hand as has been already mentioned the male can
interpret the wishes of the female from the movement she imparts to the
thread and regulates his conduct accordingly webepathy therefore
does not seem a name ill-chosen to describe this system of
intercommunication of ideas
the spider mentioned above as devouring her lover was the common garden
or geometric one as it is sometimes called which in england is the
largest example of a web-spinner in other parts of the world however
web-spinning spiders attain to a much larger size and their webs of
course are in proportion the largest perhaps are found in
madagascar and the gigantic fabrics which many of these weave are
curiously utilised by smaller spiders of a parasitic disposition who
spin their own little webs between the thick strands of those of their
hosts here they live in perfect amity with the latter in whose
presence they find a protection against the attacks of small birds—for
these it would seem stand in awe of these huge spiders in whose toils
they are sometimes accidentally caught and by whom they are then
devoured so at least vinson the historian of the spiders of
madagascar would seem to imply if he does not actually make the
statement of which i will not be quite sure[] that the great
_mygale_ of south america eats birds is now an established fact bates
having given an account of it in his well-known work _the naturalist on
the river amazon_[] in this case also the birds—for there were two
of them—were caught in a web but it was not a geometric one in which
the spider sat but a much denser and more closely woven fabric
stretched across a crevice or irregularity in the trunk of a tree the
spider—which was of much larger size than the largest _epeira_—keeping
watch behind it in the recess
[illustration: a bird-catching spider’s web]
    this enormous madagascar spider spins webs so strong that
      birds are caught and held in them in one of the large
      meshes will be seen a small parasitic spider’s web for
      catching flies and other insects the smaller spider is not
      only permitted to do this but is protected by its host from
      the attacks of the smaller birds
other spiders—as doubtless the _mygale_ if he can get them—will eat
lizards as the following account by mr frederick pollock will show:
“having procured from the deserta grande some fine specimens of this
large and handsome spider (_lycosa_—a kind of tarantula) in the early
part of this year and having provided suitable cages with glass lids
for them i was anxious to ascertain how large an animal the largest
spider would take; and for this purpose i obtained some lizards about
three inches long including the tail three of these lizards were
killed and devoured by one spider during the time i kept it they were
eaten bones and head and claws and all the only remnant of the feast
being a small ball about a quarter of an inch in diameter which was
cast aside at the bottom of the cage”[] but why were not some larger
lizards tried since there was no difficulty about three inches every
inch would have increased the fun—i mean have added to the scientific
interest but perhaps there were none larger
mr pollock goes on to say that “the islands of madeira porto santo
and deserta grande all lie within an area about fifty miles across they
have each its own peculiar large _lycosa_ no two being alike; and it is
a very remarkable fact that these _lycosæ_ vary in size inversely with
the magnitude of the island on which they are found—madeira the largest
island having the smallest _lycosa_ and deserta grande the smallest
island having by far the largest spider the mode of defence of all
these varieties of _lycosæ_ is precisely the same they elevate the
thorax raise the first pair of legs high up and opening wide asunder
their falces strike at and seize any object such as the end of a
pencil” (or the tail of a lizard) “in a most formidable manner”[]
there is another lizard-eating spider or at least a spider that will
eat lizards when formally introduced to them and that in a very
scientifically interesting manner the lizard showing such a lively
sense of its situation and the jaws of the spider working in a way
which is very curious these jaws it appears are double also
“cheliform” “denticulate” and several other things from which i
gather that there are two pairs each pair working something like the
claws of a crab but with a sawing action adapted to their toothed
surface by an extremely beautiful adjustment when the spider in
question seizes its prey one pair of jaws holds on to it whilst the
other saws into it and then the pair which has been sawing holds and
the pair which has been holding saws and so on alternately a
division and yet at the same time a combination of labour
                 “like to a double cherry seeming parted
                  but yet an union in partition”
the efficacy of the arrangement was well tested by an anglo-indian
scientist upon a lizard three inches long _exclusive_ this time of the
tail “the spider sprang upon it and made a seizure immediately behind
the shoulder the poor lizard struggled violently at first rolling over
and over in its agony but the spider kept firm hold and gradually
sawed away with its double jaws into the very entrails of its
victim”[] there was an interesting variation between this case and
the last where it will be remembered the lizards were eaten “bones
and head and claws and all” whereas here “the only parts _uneaten_ were
the jaws and part of the skin” this lizard however was “at least five
inches long from nose to extremity of tail”; but then again the spider
must have been larger too though clearly its meal was something in the
nature of a feat since after it “it remained gorged and motionless for
about a fortnight being much swollen and distended”[] there is no
mention of this in the other case which would seem to imply that the
result was different if so we have here a fact of great interest—what
fact scientifically elicited is not—but in order to establish it upon
a really firm basis further experiments should be made and once more
as the limit of size has evidently not yet been reached i would
recommend a lizard of six inches long
this spider however now i come to remember is not really one but a
_solpugid_ and a _solpugid_ is a creature so like a spider that it used
to be thought one some years ago but now belongs not only to a family
but to an order of its own which comes somewhere between the scorpions
and the true spiders they are large creatures and their bite is very
severe though it does not appear to be poisonous some of the species
are nocturnal as is the case with the one above mentioned which was
christened _galeodes vorax_ by its discoverer captain hutton if he
indeed discovered it captain hutton being a great entomologist—to
attain which title one has only to put pins through insects—used to lay
a sheet on the ground at night and stand a lantern upon it numerous
insects were attracted to the light and this brought _galeodes_—who is
a great entomologist too though without the pins—upon the _tapis_ or
_draps_[]
often there would be fights between two rivals and of these or
rather of the general fighting and one may also say yielding habits
of the species captain hutton gives the following somewhat curious
account “they plant their true feet” (for these _galeodes_ have a pair
which look exactly like feet but are really their palpi) “firmly on the
ground the body at the same time being elevated and the two pairs of
palpi held out in front to ward off the attack in this attitude they
advance and retire according as either gains a slight advantage
endeavouring to throw each other to one side so as to expose some
vulnerable part or form an opening for attack; and when this is once
effected the fortunate wrestler instantly takes advantage of it and
rushing in seizes his adversary behind the thorax and the combat is
ended the vanquished victim yielding himself without further struggle
to his inevitable fate” similarly “if in their efforts to get away
they are brought into contact the one instantly seizes the other and
devours him the victim making no struggle whatever; but if they meet
face to face they both enter into a wrestling match for life or death”
this habit of yielding as soon as there is no more use in struggling
seems a very strange one since it is opposed to the primary instinct of
self-preservation and it is not easy to see how the species can benefit
by certain individuals dying in a passive manner unless indeed by
refusing to do so they might injure the victor who by dying
afterwards would add to the tribal mortality if this be really the
explanation we are reminded of huber’s statement as to two queen bees
when each has it in its power to sting the other being seized with a
sort of horror under the influence of which they separate thus
avoiding the catastrophe of leaving the hive queenless
though as we have seen there are some spiders which eat birds and
others which eat lizards yet both these interesting things take place
abroad here however in england it would seem that we have a spider
which eats worms catching them at the end of a long woven bag which
descends into the earth and into which the worm somehow manages to get
how it does so however is not at all clear since the bag which is
sometimes a foot long is described as having no opening at either end
the spider living enclosed in it apparently a permanent prisoner still
a sac like this would seem as difficult of entry for flies as for worms
and the spider which is three-quarters of an inch in length and armed
with very large mandibles or falces—to use the approved word—must it
is plain live on something as a matter of fact it was living on a
worm when found by mr brown who gives the following account of the
matter “on drawing out one of the sacs” he says “i observed a worm at
the lower end partially within the sac and partially outside and it
was evident that the spider had been eating a considerable portion of
its anterior extremity” one would have thought that a careful
examination of the way in which the worm had got into the sac would have
thrown light on the problem but of this we hear nothing more
when taken out of the ground the sac was limp and flaccid but
afterwards the spider inflated it and it was then seen to have some
minute valves—“openings” that is to say “protected or covered by a
little valve or door” they were not however to be detected in every
nest—possibly on account of their very small size that the object of
these valvular openings is to admit air seems obvious for spiders
breathe through lungs and require a good supply of oxygen it was now
concluded both by mr brown and mr newman—a well-known
entomologist—that this particular spider lived on worms and resided
permanently in a long subterranean sac or bag which it had the power of
inflating with air a different view however was propounded by mr
meade—an authority on spiders—who suggested that the worm had only got
into the sac by accident and that the spider like other subterranean
nest-makers probably came out at night and fed abroad returning to
rest at home during the daytime to do this it would indeed have to
unweave one end of its sac—probably the upper one—and then do it up
again but there was no reason in mr meade’s opinion why it should
not act in this way to me however it seems unlikely that the minute
valves made with such care should be destroyed in this manner and made
afresh every day; and moreover when mr brown looked again at the sac
in order to test this theory he could find no evidence of its having
been dealt with in this penelopean manner there were no traces of fresh
silk the evidence therefore seems to be more in favour of _attipus
sulzeri_—for that is its name—being a genuine worm-eating spider if so
it is worthy of all respect as a curiously aberrant form[]
these spiders are of a deep brown colour with a very soft abdomen and a
generally half-baked appearance but with hard black shining
mandibles there was only a single individual—evidently the female—in
the sacs taken by mr brown but i myself was the finder of one such
sac—for i feel sure it must have been the same—in the new forest and in
this a pair were amicably settled one being about twice the size of the
other this if i mistake not was in may but i also remember or seem
to that the bag was quite open at one end thus then stand the facts
upon them i think we are justified in believing that there is a
worm-eating spider in england but of course it would be a very high
honour for any country to have such a creature so that there is a
danger of letting one’s patriotic feelings run away with one
in these sac-making spiders we see perhaps the ancestors of or rather
travellers towards those which crown a silk-lined perpendicular tunnel
with a skilfully made trap-door the latter is furnished with a hinge
and should it be discovered the spider seizing it from within
endeavours with might and main to prevent its being raised as is well
known the upper surface of these trap-doors or as we may call them
lids are covered by the spider with such materials—leaves grass moss
etc—as surround the site of its nest so that when shut down they are
indistinguishable from the general surface of the ground
another use to which the webs of spiders are put is that of a parachute
on which the little creature—for small species alone may enjoy this
luxury—sails delicately through the air this however is not the
nearest approach made by any of the tribe to actual flight though in
practice it almost surpasses that power even as possessed by many
winged insects who do indeed cleave the air but cannot ride upon it in
a filmy chariot twinkling in the rays of the sun still there is one
spider that though it has not yet achieved wings is in process of
developing them this little semi-ariel—but the subject will be best
done justice to in the glowing language of the rev o p cambridge:
“adult male length rather above two lines the abdomen is of an
elongated oval form and rather flattened; its upper side is furnished
with an epidermis which is continued laterally on either side to an
extent considerably exceeding the width of the abdomen and of a
semi-oval or elliptical form; the outer portion of this epidermis on
either side is capable of being depressed and folded round the abdomen
or elevated and expanded to its full width after the manner of wings
mr h h b bradley of sydney new south wales to whom i am indebted
for examples of this exceedingly interesting and remarkable spider
tells me that he has observed them elevating and depressing the flaps
and also actually using them as wings or supporters to sustain the
length of their leaps that this as with an analogous appendage in the
flying squirrel should be intended for such sustentation one could have
but little doubt after examining it even in the preserved specimens
the three examples were all found on one spot near sydney in the month
of october running and jumping on low plants and flowers”[]
it is delightful to think of a little delicate spider-body like this
rising gracefully from the petal of one flower expanding its thin
filmy fringes and descending in a long slanting line through the air
like a flying squirrel or a galeopithecus onto the petal of another
even were its appearance no more than elegant this would be a most
pleasing sight but it is much more than this various hues meet in its
diminutive body and so harmonious and pleasing is the general effect
produced by them that the first captor of so much loveliness was
enraptured as he gazed on his prize whilst even mr cambridge with
only dried specimens to fire his imagination yet cannot choose but
exclaim: “it is difficult to describe adequately the great beauty of the
colouring of this spider”[]
spiders then either through gossamer or their own structural
modification seem engaged in the conquest of the air there remains but
the water and this element also they have partly subdued there are
raft-spiders and diving-bell spiders the first having woven a few
dried leaves stalks grasses etc launches out as courageously from
the shore as the first navigator whose heart according to horace was
thrice bound in brass but who probably was timid and cautious our
spider however has no fears nor need it to have any since no sort of
capsizal can affect a structure which answers its purpose as well one
side up as another; whilst even if it were to sink—though that hardly
lies in its nature—there is always the water to run on the raft in
fact is only like the nest or web ashore—a place to have a comfortable
meal in the prey—some aquatic insect—is caught generally on the surface
of the stream and the spider after each successful raid skims back
with her booty to the little self-guiding boat which it has temporarily
left there when no longer hungry she sits and scuds about careless
and pleasure-loving like another little phædria in her “flitt barck”
over the waters of the idle lake[]
“thus” says büchner “everywhere in nature are battle craft and
ingenuity all following the merciless law of egoism in order to
maintain their own lives and to destroy those of others” in man
indeed there is some counterpoise to all this in the mind and _façon de
parler_; but the lower animals do not think so much and having no
proper language cannot even talk altruistically
lastly we have the water-spider whose little spun nest against the
submerged stem of some aquatic plant is open at the bottom like a
diving-bell and filled with air which its owner carries down from the
surface in successive bubbles each one looking “like a globe of
quicksilver” to collect them she swims on her back and in some
manner entangles them amongst the numerous hairs with which her abdomen
is covered where they cling safely all through the journey
                     “proud of that delicate lodgment”
there may be other bubbles as pretty perhaps but few by bursting do
such good to those who have cherished them in winter it would seem
the spider closes the entrance to the diving-bell and sleeps dry and
                              chapter xxiv
    aquatic insects—lyonnet’s water-beetle—a floating cradle—larva
      and pupa—an ingenious contrivance—nothing useless—the
      imaginary philosopher—how the cradle is made—the mysterious
      “mast”—later observation—the giant water-bug—an oppressed
      husband
spiders having brought us to the water it may be as well or even
better in view of the title of this work to say something about
water-insects of these so long as the water be fresh and not salt
there are many and the largest perhaps if he exceeds some of the
dragon-fly larvæ and the giant water-bug of america must be the great
water-beetle—_hydrophilus piceus_—which is larger even than the much
commoner one—_dytiscus_—which everybody knows and which is _the_
water-beetle to most people
it is the fate of some animals to become associated for all time in our
minds with the name of some particular man as for instance the bee is
with that of huber and the ephemera with that of swammerdam again the
fame of lyonnet though he was skilled in eight languages and became
cypher secretary and confidential translator to the united provinces of
holland is principally bound up with a certain caterpillar viz that
of the goat moth of which creature though only an amateur in such
matters he made dissections and executed plates which have never yet
been surpassed and are supposed to be entirely unsurpassable in a
lesser degree his memory is associated with this particular
water-beetle—the great one into the heart of whose mystery he was the
first to pierce: “in the beginning of july” he tells us “i had noticed
in the ditches a kind of cocoon which i did not recognise it was
whitish of the size of the end of the finger nearly spherical but
rather oval and flattened the surface which looked like tow was not
quite smooth one of the two ends was flatter than the other and
furnished with a raised rim from the space within this rim projected a
sort of little tapering mast about as long as the cocoon”[]
these cocoons when opened were found to contain about a hundred eggs
lyonnet kept them in water till the eggs hatched “the larvæ” he says
when this had taken place “remained one day enclosed in the cocoon
before escaping then they made an oval aperture in the lower part of
the flattened end of the cocoon and escaped through this into the
water”[] here they fed upon snails their manner of eating which is
thus described: “the larva seizes the snail with its mandibles then
bends its body backwards and rests the snail upon the broad back which
serves as a table (as with the larva of the grain-eating ant of texas)
in this position holding the snail in its legs the larva breaks the
shell and devours it”[]
when full-fed the larvæ left the water and one of them was placed by
lyonnet in a box full of moistened earth this it entered and some
days afterwards changed into a large white pupa or chrysalis about
which there was one curious feature viz that “on each side of the
head”—or as an entomologist would say nowadays “on the fore part of
the prothorax—were three brown strong hooks two others of the same
kind were found at the hinder end of the body”[] these hooks were
solid so that they could contain no part of the perfect insect and
lyonnet points to them as good examples of _apparently_ useless
structures their office indeed he himself knows but he does not
reveal it till the usual philosopher has been imagined who denies that
they can have any then of course comes the anticipated discomfiture
of this unwary person—so frequent in the eighteenth century—who
unwarned by experience has walked quietly into the trap “in the damp
earth which the pupa requires the above-described hooks fulfil a
purpose unexpected by us but at the same time of great importance
the skin of the pupa is very delicate lying on damp earth it could
hardly escape injury and the weight of the body might easily give it a
distorted shape but (_monsieur le philosophe_) the pupa protects itself
from these dangers by assuming an unusual attitude it extends itself
back downwards in a horizontal position and supports the weight of its
body by the three sets of hooks as upon a tripod in this attitude
though surrounded on all sides by moist earth it keeps its body from
actual contact with any object until it has assumed its final shape
thus” continues lyonnet turning full upon the stupefied philosopher
“we see how necessary are those hooks which at first sight appeared so
useless to decide that this or that structure is superfluous because we
cannot guess its use is truly ridiculous in beings whose information is
so limited as ours”[] applauding shouts (“_mais certainement!_”
“_c’est vrai cela!_”) rend the air and the imaginary philosopher goes
out in a state of painful confusion
the above facts first made known by lyonnet have been confirmed by
subsequent observers such as miger and the pupa of another and much
smaller water-beetle is now known to support itself in the same manner
or rather on the same principle since the place of hooks at either
extremity is taken by spiny projections with which the back is covered
lyonnet now turned his attention to the mature beetle and especially to
the female whom he was anxious to see make her cocoon having put a few
in a large wooden trough and supplied them with some floating weed “i
had” he says “before long the pleasure of seeing the female
_hydrophilus_ betake herself to work under my eyes i found to my
surprise that like the spider she had her spinneret at the hinder end
of the body two small brown prominences enclosed each a delicate
conical tube from each of which a separate thread proceeded and with
these the cocoon was woven in the following way at first lying
upside-down near the surface of the water the beetle buried the hinder
part of her body and the two hindermost pairs of legs in the weed
whilst with the first pair which were free she drew and pressed the
weed around the end of her body moulding it to its shape she then
began to weave what seemed the under half of her cocoon but having
finished this part she turned over with it so that it became the upper
half and then wove the real under one the two curved surfaces were
then woven together and in about an hour and a quarter the body of the
cocoon was finished for about two hours after this the beetle remained
still her back being uppermost at first her body was buried in the
cocoon up to the thorax but one could see that she was gradually
withdrawing it during these two hours of apparent rest she laid her
eggs not at hazard but in regular order side by side the pointed
ends uppermost this work accomplished she closed the mouth of the
cocoon and then began to spin the little mast which gradually rose
above the surface of the water till it had attained the requisite
height and the cocoon was then finished”[]
lyonnet was unable to discover the use of the so-called mast and it
remains a mystery to this day so that the imaginary philosopher might
have a better chance here were it not his _métier_ to be put to
confusion it is hollow and as the cocoon contains air with which the
beetle supplies it—just as the water-spider does her diving-bell—miger
whose observations were made in  some fifty years after those of
lyonnet supposed it might serve as the channel of entry but although
hollow it has no orifice but is closed at the end and this does not
seem to accord with the above view mr g a laker a modern observer
does not think that the spike can serve as a balance to the cocoon
since this is usually attached to some weed or other supporting
substance he however cut the spike off two of the cocoons and the
eggs in both of these remained unhatched moreover these cocoons
subsequently sank whereas in their normal state they “are so
constructed that when floating loose the spike retains its proper
position and even if the cocoon be held so that the spike is parallel
with the water and then suddenly released it immediately rights
itself”[] the balance theory therefore certainly seems to have
something in its favour lyonnet’s own conjecture was that the mast as
he calls it—a designation against which miger protests—might merely
represent the waste silk which the beetle felt impelled to get rid of
the time taken by the beetle in making the whole cocoon is about five
hours whilst the mast spike or turned-up point as miger severely
calls it takes it half an hour it is curious that whereas lyonnet’s
cocoons held “about a hundred” eggs mr laker gives the number as
“usually between fifty and sixty”[]
as space has its exigencies—and long may it continue to have—i will here
merely mention such names as _gyrinus_ _dytiscus_ _hydrobius_
_donacia_ etc “and let _them_ speak for me” but having paid some
attention to the great water-beetle silence in regard to the giant
water-bug would be hardly gracious and might be ill taken this
terrific creature is like a monstrous exaggeration of our own
water-scorpion to which it bears a distorted but real resemblance
minus however the long ovipositor—the so-called tail behind its
appearance is not to be described like other bugs and as are the
aphides and cicadas for less cruel purposes it is armed with a long
sharp-pointed beak through which having plunged it into the body of
its prey on whose back it has previously leaped it sucks the
life-juices holding on all the while with its two curved claw-like
front legs its strength is in accordance with its size and both are
such that it finds no one in its own circle so to speak at all capable
of contending with it “it is the facile master of the ponds and
estuaries of the tidal creeks and rivers of the atlantic states” says
uhler “developing in the quiet pools secreting itself beneath stones
or rubbish it watches the approach of a _pomotis_ mud-minnow frog or
other small-sized tenant of the water when it darts with sudden
rapidity upon its unprepared victim grasps the creature with its
strong clasping fore-legs plunges its deadly beak deep into the flesh
and proceeds with the utmost coolness to leisurely suck its blood a
copious supply of saliva is poured into the wound and no doubt aids in
producing the paralysis which so speedily follows its puncture in small
creatures”[]
another american water-bug of similar build but much smaller size has
the same general habits to which it adds the more special one of
carrying about its eggs on its back where in time they are hatched
but do not it would appear—though this seems somewhat out of harmony
with the practical spirit of nature—proceed at once to suck their
parent’s blood an omission which as it would be a most moving instance
of unselfish surrender on the part of the latter is perhaps to be
regretted possibly the reason is that the eggs are not fixed upon the
right back so that even were this _dénouement_ to take place we should
not have an instance of maternal but only of paternal affection this
for some reason is not so effective as the other and therefore nature
who as we know is a consummate artist may not care to waste her
materials on an inferior situation
be this as it may the fact that the domestic economy of these
water-bugs did not proceed throughout upon the lines that might have
been expected may first have led a german observer—schmidt—to suspect
something unusual in consequence of which misgiving he looked more
closely into the matter and found—what had not before been
imagined—that the male and not the female was the egg-bearer he was
not however able to determine how this arrangement was brought about
or with what feelings the male received and bore his burden this was
left for miss slater who found that the females in her aquarium
insisted upon laying their eggs on the backs of the males that the
latter objected to their doing so which led to a struggle between the
two often lasting for two or three hours but ending invariably in the
victory of the female the male has then to bow to necessity but he
does not do so in a cheerful spirit nor even without some further
efforts to escape his destiny “that he chafes under the burden” says
miss slater “is unmistakable; in fact my suspicions as to the sex of
the egg-carrier were first aroused by watching one in an aquarium which
was trying to free itself from its load of eggs an exhibition of a lack
of maternal interest not to be expected in a female carrying her own
eggs generally the _zaithas_ are very active darting about with great
rapidity but an egg-bearer remains quietly clinging to a leaf with the
end of the abdomen just out of the water if attacked he meekly receives
the blows seemingly preferring death (which in several cases was the
result) to the indignity of carrying and caring for the eggs”[] this
last however is not very explicit so that the whole account not
being to hand i cannot say what precisely happened
it is curious that the male should be so spiritless after receiving the
eggs for this would seem to nullify such advantages as the arrangement
might otherwise offer the eggs must be laid somewhere and might be
supposed safer on the back of the male than elsewhere—in which fact
perhaps we may see the origin of the instinct but if the male sinking
under his burden is able neither to defend himself nor it this
advantage seems nullified
estuaries and tidal creeks which as we have seen are included in the
habitat of these water-bugs—at least of the giant one—bring us
gradually to the sea that there are marine insects we know but they do
not appear to extend beyond the tidal beach on the sands of which they
expatiate when the sea is out and burrow into them on its return all
are small and still smaller is the amount said about them even in such
works as are precisely those where all that is known on the subject
ought to be stated—systematic works of natural history for instance
which take “_arthropoda_ (insects etc)” in their due order but do not
so much as tell you whether marine ones exist or not yet the date of
such works is after  for these reasons and another which has been
once or twice before alluded to i have but one remark to make about
marine insects and i will make that in the next chapter
                              chapter xxv
    one remark—phosphorescent insects—glow-worms and
      fire-flies—fiery courtship—a beetle with three
      lamps—travelling by beetle-light—the great lantern-fly
      controversy—is it luminous—madame merian’s
      statement—contradictory evidence—a chinese edict—suggested
      use of the “lantern”—confirmation required—luminous
      centipedes
no marine insect—this is the remark—is phosphorescent—that is to say as
far as i know which is a very saving clause indeed this seems curious
because as everyone knows other sea-dwelling creatures are producing
most wonderful and beautiful effects and moreover the luminous
property is active in many terrestrial insects of these the glow-worm
is a familiar and though perhaps the humblest a very beautiful
example at any rate there are insects of the glow-worm family whose
fires are far less “ineffectual” or to speak more truly far outglow
those of our own species what for instance can be more gorgeous than
the green or orange lights—for they differ in colour according to the
sexes—with which the nights and the rich vegetation of the west indies
are brilliantly yet softly lit up nothing surely if it be not the
name of the creature producing such splendour which is _pygolampis
xanthophotis_[]—not one syllable less
whether it is the male or the female that gives out the green or the
orange light i do not know nor in my opinion do various monographists
in various encyclopædias and text-books though they make no such
avowal but content themselves with not saying however it is not a
matter of importance except to the insect producing it in whose breast
the one or the other colour arouses very different sensations—rivalry or
love for there is no doubt now that these lovely illuminations as well
as those of our own glow-worm and of every other light-bearing creature
have relation to the needs and wants of their producers to whose
æsthetic sense and not to ours they are intended to appeal that they
appeal also to our own is a mere irrelevant side-issue not considered
so to speak by the force under whose pressure these beauties were
called forth and not of the smallest consequence it was not always
thought so and were the pride of man reachable by such considerations
it might humiliate us to reflect that displays which in real beauty
immeasurably surpass our clumsy illuminations and fireworks are made
nightly not for our eyes but for those of a beetle
on which one of his editors of the nineteenth remarks: “this is still
the generally received notion but the fact is that both sexes of the
glow-worm are phosphorescent not only in the perfect insect but also
in the larva and even pupa state”[] but this does not affect white’s
statement which is the simple fact as well as “the generally received
notion” and moreover though our own male glow-worm is phosphorescent
it is not so brilliantly so as the female indeed in the ninth edition
of the _encyclopædia britannica_—which is later than this editorial
note—it is stated not to be so at all so that even if white believed
this—which is not very clear—he has been supported by learned authority
for a very long time
in other species the male is the more brilliant or the sexes do not
differ greatly in this respect each one lighting its “amorous fire” in
the degree that nature allows it to—as no doubt our own male does too
of this fact which in the light of darwinism might have been boldly
assumed there is no longer any doubt after professor emery’s
interesting observations[] on the italian species _luciola italica_
these were made in the meadows around bologna where having caught some
females the professor imprisoned them in glass tubes and laid them down
amidst the grass in this situation though smell as an attractive agent
was excluded males would come flashing to the glass and on the other
hand as soon as the lamp of any of these became visible the female
would kindle her own if it had previously been unlighted arrived on
the spot the male would dash madly about the unapproachable female who
continued to light her lamp at him till another and then others
arrived when it is to be supposed that her favours were distributed in
the end there would sometimes be a dozen fiery rivals glowing and
flashing round the tube but though the female shot out her attractive
beams with evident intent to please it does not appear that she was the
seeker in the business since we hear only of males flying to the
imprisoned females and not of females pursuing these males to such
modest merit therefore as a nice distinction between different ways of
attaining the same end may entitle her the female glow-worm also is
entitled
the light of the two sexes in the italian glow-worm is described by
professor emery as being the same in colour and intensity but differing
in some other respects the flashes of the male for instance are more
quickly recurrent whilst those of the female gleam out at longer
intervals but last for a longer time they are also more tremulous
as well as more restricted though what is meant by this last
expression since the brightness is said to be equal is not quite
apparent possibly it may imply that the light proceeds from a lesser
area of the body but if so this should be clearly stated even in a
_résumé_ i can find no reference to such a fact if it be one in the
text-books
from the above it is evident that the glow-worm’s fires are anything but
“uneffectual” from the point of view of the insect but shakespeare was
no doubt thinking of something very different—their paling namely
before the light of dawn according to gilbert white however they
should have been out long ago—the glow-worm being too wise to afford
opportunities of comparison in this respect thus subtly does the
naturalist of selborne impugn the accuracy of the bard of avon: “by
observing” he says “two glow-worms which were brought from the field
to the bank in the garden it appeared to us that these little creatures
put out their lamps between eleven and twelve and shine no more for the
rest of the night”[] the intention here though cleverly disguised
is not sufficiently so to escape detection it was possibly seen through
by the late charles and mary cowden clarke who in one of the million or
so notes to their edition of shakespeare say without distinct
reference to the passage in question:—“_uneffectual_ there is double
signification included in this word; it means the glow-worm’s light
which shines without giving heat and which no longer shows when morning
appears”[] thus whilst not committing themselves to white’s opinion
they provide a safe refuge for their author in case it should prove in
time to be correct; according to the sound principle contained in a
russian proverb which says “had he known where he was going to fall he
would have laid down straw”
in tropical countries fire-flies take the place of glow-worms with us
and though the light which these give out is not so soft and poetic as
the lovely green or golden green one of the latter yet it is more
effectively beautiful owing to the way in which it wanders through the
night appearing and disappearing in successive brilliant flashes for
here the beetle that carries the lamp is a flier and flashes it about
at pleasure through the air having the power it would seem either of
showing or concealing its light the effect of a number of these points
of brilliancy gleaming out now here now there on the soft night air
of the tropics is inexpressibly beautiful as though in a smaller
firmament innumerable miniature stars had ceaseless birth and death
women who like to emphasise their own beauty or the want of it by
placing themselves in juxtaposition with every lovely thing in nature
and care not if a thousand deaths go to help one smile or glance have
not forgotten the fire-flies they put them in their hair or wire them
onto their dresses threading them together sometimes in long bands
which they wind about their fair—or otherwise—persons; they do this
more especially when going out to parties fancy-dress balls or other
social entertainments the advantages are obvious for the homeliest
features may be thus lighted up and the dullest woman become brilliant
no wonder that in some south american cities—vera cruz for example—these
fire-fly beetles form quite an important article of trade all for
toilette purposes[] the natives catch them by waving sticks with
burning coals tied to their ends through the air by the light of which
they are attracted and so come within reach of a long-handled butterfly
net when caught they are put into a box covered with a little netting
of wire and there kept till wanted they are fed upon sugar-cane and
twice a day must be bathed in tepid water[]
what is done with the poor beetles after they have contributed to the
night’s amusement we are never told—whether those that have been all
wired together are unwired and let go or pulled off in two or more
pieces to save trouble as seems more likely it is likelier still
perhaps in the houses of the rich that the whole thing is flung aside
and the poor living lamps left to struggle till they die—unprovided with
sugar-cane but such details are not thought worth mentioning the
charming effect is the one thing dwelt upon and charming it may very
well be though to gain it through a mass of even insect discomfort is
to my mind a contemptible thing fancy fifty or a hundred
uncomfortable writhing struggling things on the dress that a lady is
dancing in every one of which if let go would make a wandering star
in the air more really worth looking at than the whole ball-room
together! by substituting flowers for women however effects far more
beautiful are gained through less reprehensible means the
fire-beetles—why should they be called flies—are in this case confined
in small globes of delicate glass set amidst clusters of flowers or
flowering shrubs and thus they softly illuminate the garden give them
some sugar-cane whilst the party is in progress and let them go next
morning and they will have had very little to complain of—a strange
experience for any lower creature that gets into the clutches of the
highest one
the most wonderful of all the fire-beetles is the large one of near two
inches long—quite or more if we count the antennæ—that inhabits
mexico where in ancient times it was used as a lantern by the aztecs in
their night-journeys as it still is by their modern descendants it is
wonderful not by reason of its size merely or in any special degree
of the light it emits—though this is brilliant in proportion to it—but
because it carries three separate lamps: two above situated on either
side of the thorax and one on the under side just in front of the
abdomen thus as it turns or varies in its flight one flash of the
most intense brilliancy follows another like the revolving light of a
lighthouse the colour of the light is described as a rich
green—richest however or at least brightest on the under
surface[] the beauty and dazzling effect of this upon a dark night
can be imagined and is thus described by dr kidder: “before retracing
my steps i stood for a few moments looking down into the cimmerian
blackness of the gulf before me; and while thus gazing a luminous mass
seemed to start from the very centre i watched it as it floated up
revealing in its slow flight the long leaves of the palm _euterpe
edulis_ and the minuter foliage of other trees it came directly
towards me lighting up the gloom around with its three luminosities
which i could distinctly see”[] there is something wonderfully
poetical in the thought of winged beings like this pursuing each other
through the night by the light of these glorious flashes—the “light of
their own loveliness” it may well be called since it is indeed their
beauty if seems curious and a waste that where there is the greatest
capacity of poetic imagination we should find the least or almost the
least realisation of it in habit and structure
we know from oviedo that the mexican indians when they travelled at
night were accustomed to fasten these great refulgent beetles on their
hands and feet and thus pass flaming through the country they danced
too by their light and even wove or painted by it why therefore
could not lamps of great power as well as beauty be evolved from such
insects by bringing the selective agency of man to bear upon them the
phosphorescent principle in living nature has not perhaps been made the
most of by us was more made of it by the aztecs and did they turn
their attention to the systematic rearing of these living lamps—for
from hearing so little about them one would not think that these insects
were so useful now as from the above account and what other
contemporary spanish writers tell us it would seem that they were at
the time of this old and cruelly destroyed civilisation
holder in his work on phosphorescent animals either quotes or refers
to prescott as saying that “when the spaniards visited the country”—that
is mexico “the air was filled with the _cucujo_ a species of large
beetle which emits an intense phosphoric light from its body strong
enough to enable one to read by these wandering flies seen in the
darkness of the night were converted by the excited imagination of the
besieged into an army of matchlocks” surely from such a foundation
something as superior to it as are our cultivated fruits or domestic
breeds to the wild stocks from which they sprung might in no long time
be produced since it is not to be supposed but that some individuals of
the _pyrophorus_ give a stronger light than others the above passage
by the way if it be from the _conquest of mexico_ as one might suppose
it to be is most carefully concealed in the index which however it
might very well be and yet exist as i know from much teasing
experience as to the matchlocks would to heaven the old mexicans as
well as the peruvians had had them or still better -inch
howitzers i might then have something more to say about these wonderful
beetles all i can add now is that the light appears to be used by the
insect as a guide to its own movements since when the celebrated dr
dubois covered one of the side ones with wax this caused the individual
so treated to walk in a curve and when “both spots were covered it soon
stopped and then moved in an uncertain manner carefully feeling the
ground with its antennæ”[] but i do not know if “both” here means
all three of the lamps or only the two upper ones
if there be any luminous insect that eclipses the _pyrophorus_ it must
be the great lantern-fly—also of south america—provided only that the
great lantern-fly _is_ luminous that is a most essential point and it
does not appear yet to have been satisfactorily made out the principal
evidence on the affirmative side is that of madame merian who was right
about the _mygale_—the great bird-killing spider—and who here speaks as
an actual eye-witness her account is as follows: “the indians” she
says “once brought me before i knew that they shone at night a large
number of these lantern-flies which i shut up in a large wooden box in
the night they made such a noise that i awoke in a fright and ordered a
light to be brought not knowing from whence the noise proceeded as
soon as we found that it came from the box we opened it but were still
more alarmed and let it fall to the ground in a fright at seeing a
flame of fire come out of it; and as many animals as came out so many
flames of fire appeared when we found this to be the case we recovered
from our fright and again collected the insects highly admiring their
splendid appearance”[]
here then is a definite statement from which all possibility of
mistake seems excluded if as i suppose is the case there is no doubt
as to the specific identity of the insect which was the subject of it
and which is thus described by mr holder in the work already mentioned:
“the _fulgora lanternaria_ of south america” he tells us “is nearly
three and a half inches long from tip of head to extremity of tail (ie
abdomen) and almost five and a half inches broad with its wings
expanded” truly a goodly insect of right portly dimensions and if it
be not really luminous—upon occasions at any rate for it certainly is
not so generally—it is so much the greater pity but to continue: “the
body is of a lengthened oval shape while the head is distinguished by a
singular prolongation which sometimes equals the rest of the body in
size” this is a most remarkable appendage if it may be called so
hollow and with a blown-up inflated sort of look it does indeed to
some extent resemble a chinese lantern and seems made to be lighted up
the colour too suggests this since it is striped longitudinally with
red and yellow presenting quite a gala appearance accordingly it is
said to be here that the luminous property of this strange insect
exists this is its lantern and by reason of it it has received its
name of lantern-fly
and yet since that night when madame merian had her interesting
experience we meet with no one apparently who can unequivocally say
that he has seen the great lantern-fly with its lantern alight on the
other hand we have some second-hand statements which have almost the
value of first such as that of m westmael who “assures us that a
friend of his observed the luminosity”;[] whilst “john c branner
phd states that when in south america he was often informed that it
was luminous but never could find anyone who had personally seen the
light”[] the curious thing is that there are other lantern-flies
belonging to other parts of the world and in regard to them too we have
the same doubt and discrepancy the same assurances and general belief
the same categorical denials thus a distinguished authority on the
subject of phosphorescence— dr phipson—in referring to the smaller
chinese species _fulgora candelaria_—the candle-fly—says: “it is from
these appendages the sides of which are transparent that the
phosphoric light appears” and again: “it is said also that the trunk of
a tree covered with numerous individuals of _fulgora candelaria_ some
in movement others in repose presents a very grand spectacle
impossible to describe but which may be witnessed sometimes in
china”[] it would seem too that there exists a chinese edict which
forbids young women to keep these candle-flies; and if this is not with
the idea of preventing their use as signals or of checking vanity it
is difficult to see what the object of such an enactment can be
lastly we are told by packard in his _guide to insects_ that “mr
caleb cooke of salem who resided several years in zanzibar africa
told me that the lantern-fly is said by the native to be luminous they
state that the long snout lights up in the night and in describing it
say its head is like a lamp (_keetchwa kand-tah_)”
all this evidence appears to me to point in one way and one way only—i
mean of course in its entirety since otherwise it points in two ways
but even if it is possible that in one country alone an insect—well
known and conspicuous—can have got the reputation of being luminous
without really being so at least occasionally this can hardly have
come about in regard to the same or some allied insect in three or
four countries added to this we have madame merian’s direct evidence
but on the other hand it is perfectly clear that these insects are not
always or even generally luminous the conclusion then seems
irresistible that they occasionally are so that for some reason or
other the phosphorescent principle is active in them only at certain
times or seasons why this should be so we do not know but there is
nothing inconceivable in it; and some other animals—for instance
centipedes—would seem to be luminous at some times and not at others
the so-called lantern or snout being a very remarkable organ for which
some use must be assumed the likelihood of its sometimes becoming a
lamp would be increased considerably if so far as we knew it
performed no other office this was how the case stood till lately; but
in  there was the skeat expedition for scientific purposes to the
malay archipelago and on its return mr nelson annandale propounded a
theory in regard to the more ordinary use at least of the organ in
question which was based on his own observation his account is as
follows: “the curious anterior prolongation of the head in many genera
of the _fulgoridæ_ has long puzzled entomologists at biserat in jalor
i was fortunate enough to observe the real use of this peculiar
structural modification on the morning of may th i noticed a specimen
of _hotinus spinola_ seated on the trunk of a durian tree in the
village and incautiously attempted to catch it in my hand the insect
remained almost still merely drawing in its legs towards its body and
pressing the claws firmly against the bark until i had almost touched
it then it lowered its head with very great rapidity flew up into the
air without spreading its wings and alighted on the roof of a house six
feet behind a tree and considerably higher than its position on the
trunk had been at the time i did not notice anything peculiar in the
way in which this _fulgorid_ jumped for there are many large species of
the same family which without being provided with long noses can leap
for a considerable distance by means of their legs only; but as i was
examining my specimen (a dead one) i was struck by an indentation or
crease that ran across the central region of the nose at right angles to
its main axis then i discovered that at this point and at this point
only it was flexible and that if the tip of the nose and the dorsal
surface of the abdomen were pressed together between the finger and
thumb and then suddenly released the insect would not fall straight to
the ground but would be propelled for some distance through the air
before doing so just as would be the case if a piece of whalebone were
treated in like manner”[]
mr annandale then goes on to show or to suggest that the
_fulgorid_—as he calls it—by pressing its snout—or lantern—against the
tree-trunk and at the same time pushing itself off from it with its
legs “would fly into the air at a tangent” and he continues: “i have
no doubt that this is substantially what occurs in the case of
_hotinus_; but in the living insect the action is far too rapid for the
eye to discriminate its details and dead specimens cannot be made to
leap in this way because it is impossible to force the legs to perform
their part of the action”[] such then is the theory but as other
members of the family jump in much the same way to all appearance
without any such apparatus and since the bending of the head at such a
moment might be correlated with the movements requisite to produce such
a leap as this it certainly wants confirmation
some of the finest displays of luminosity have been observed in
centipedes which although not insects may be counted such for the
purpose of this volume thus m audouin noticing one night a light
proceeding from one of his chicory-fields “ordered his man to turn up
the earth when the scene that followed is described as truly
magnificent the soil appeared as if it had been sprinkled with molten
gold the display being intensified if the insects were trodden upon or
rubbed in the latter case streaks of light appeared as if a bit of
phosphorus had been placed upon the hands the light being distinctly
visible for twenty seconds”[]
mr brodhurst again referring to another species—_geophilus
electricus_—about an inch and a half in length and in the daytime
inconspicuous enough says: “the light looked like moonlight so bright
was it through the trees it was a dark night warm and sultry taking a
letter i could read it it resembled an electric light and proceeded
from two centipedes and their trails the light illuminated the entire
body of the animal and seemed to increase its diameter three times it
flashed along both sides of the creature in sections there being about
six from head to tail between which the light played moving as it
were perpetually in two streams the trail extended one and a half feet
from each centipede over the grass and gravel walk and it had the
appearance of illuminated mucus on securing one of the creatures for
examination i found on touching it the light was instantly
extinguished”[] 
the display is therefore voluntary nor could mr
brodhurst ever get his centipedes to shine in captivity
    scorpions and suicide—the act proved—intention
      probable—conflicting evidence—scorpions and
      cockroaches—concentrating backwards—economy of
      poison—decorous feeding
the assertion that scorpions are occasionally luminous—if indeed it has
ever been seriously made—does not appear to have received confirmation
of fire indeed these creatures have a horror but that probably
relates to its property—heat—to which they are extremely sensitive the
popular belief is that if surrounded by fire a scorpion will
deliberately sting itself to death of the fact or at least of the
fact of the self-inflicted sting there can be little doubt but in
regard to the motive there is room for difference of opinion mr pocock
says truly enough that it is _à priori_ improbable that the scorpion
has any intention of killing itself[] but what then is its
intention in stinging itself supposing that it deliberately does so
nor must it be forgotten that the idea of death—of destruction—must be
indissolubly associated in the scorpion’s mind with the use of its
sting since it uses it with that purpose only and that is the result
which constantly attends its use is it then really so improbable that
it stings itself with the same intention as that with which it stings
other creatures—or rather with what other possible intention can it
do so assuming the act to be a voluntary one
nor would it be necessary to prove the intention that the sting thus
delivered should be fatal in its effects and in regard to this mr
bourne has satisfied himself by experiments with some indian scorpions
that a self-inflicted wound or even wounds inflicted by individuals of
the same species on one another have no effect on the other hand he
found that a moderately high temperature was fatal to his scorpions and
so concludes that this has been the real cause of death in all such
cases as we are here considering[]
the above theory however hardly accords with the experience of mr w
g bidie also of india and that very part of it where mr bourne’s
experiments were made—viz madras writing to _nature_ he says: “one
morning a servant brought me a large specimen of this scorpion (the
common black one of southern india) which having stayed out too long
in its nocturnal rambles had apparently got bewildered at daybreak and
been unable to find its way home to keep it safe the creature was at
once put into a glazed entomological case having a few leisure minutes
in the course of the forenoon i thought i would see how my prisoner was
getting on and to have a better view of it the case was placed in a
window in the rays of the hot sun the light and heat seemed to irritate
it very much and this recalled to my mind a story which i had read
somewhere that a scorpion on being surrounded with fire had committed
suicide i hesitated about subjecting my pet to such a terrible ordeal
but taking a common botanical lens i focussed the rays of the sun on
its back” (so that apollo may have flayed marsyas as a mild
alternative) “the moment this was done it began to run hurriedly about
the case hissing and spitting in a very fierce way this experiment was
repeated some four or five times with like results but on trying it
once again the scorpion turned up its tail and plunged the sting quick
as lightning into its own back the infliction of the wound was
followed by a sudden escape of fluid and a friend standing by me
called out ‘see! it has stung itself: it is dead’ and sure enough in
less than half a minute life was quite extinct”
this seems plain enough the scorpion had not died of the heat up to
the moment at which it stung itself—an act which would require some
vital energy it did sting itself and in less than half a minute
afterwards it was dead moreover as the experiments with the lens were
intermittent there seems no more reason why the last one should have
been fatal than the other four or five it is perhaps possible to
imagine that the scorpion was almost dead before that the last heating
caused it to expire and that in the moment of doing so it stung itself
by involuntary muscular action there is nothing however in the
narrative to suggest this but quite the contrary
supposing the sting to have been a voluntary act what could the
scorpion have intended except to injure itself had it ever in its life
used its sting with any other purpose than that of doing injury mr
bidie adds: “i have written this brief note to show () that animals may
commit suicide; () that the poison of certain animals may be
destructive to themselves”[]
writing several years later also to _nature_ dr allen thomson
frs gives the following account not indeed of his own experience
but that of an eye-witness in whom he feels full confidence he says:
“while residing many years ago during the summer months at the baths
of sulla in italy in a somewhat damp locality my informant together
with the rest of the family was much annoyed by the frequent intrusion
of small black scorpions into the house and their being secreted among
the bedclothes in shoes and other articles of dress it thus became
necessary to be constantly on the watch for these troublesome creatures
and to take means for their removal and destruction having been
informed by the natives of the place that the scorpion would destroy
itself if exposed to a sudden light my informant and her friends soon
became adepts in catching the scorpions and disposing of them in the
manner suggested this consisted in confining the animal under an
inverted drinking-glass or tumbler below which a card was inserted and
then waiting till dark suddenly bringing the light of a candle near to
the glass in which the animal was confined no sooner was this done than
the scorpion invariably showed signs of great excitement running round
and round the interior of the tumbler with reckless velocity for a
number of times this state having lasted for a minute or more the
animal suddenly became quiet and turning its tail on the hinder part
of its body over its back brought its recurved sting down upon the
middle of the head and piercing it forcibly in a few seconds became
quite motionless and in fact quite dead this observation was
repeated very frequently”[]
here again it is difficult to see how a mistake in observation can
have occurred and admitting the facts to be true they go far beyond
mr bourne’s theory to account for these phenomena which however has
been adopted by mr pocock as the result of his own experiments in the
first place it is not here the heat—unless by association of ideas—but
the actual sight of the flame that terrifies the scorpion and death
apparently is inflicted as the result of that again there can be no
doubt as to the self-inflicted stinging and from the manner of it as
well as its invariability it seems to have been deliberate whether
death was the result of it or not we have the act and the act if a
voluntary one must have implied a destructive intention it hardly
seems possible however that the light of a candle outside a tumbler
though held near it can in so short a time have made the interior so
hot as to kill the scorpion whilst on the other hand the poison from
the creature’s sting must have pierced its brain and a few seconds
afterwards it was dead
if then we decide to disbelieve in the story of scorpions committing
suicide when unable to escape from fire we must explain away these two
accounts which we can do by supposing the narrators to be either
dishonest or stupid there is no other way that i can see so if neither
of these do we ought to believe the story however there is plenty of
evidence which points in the opposite direction and the advantage of
this is that we can take our choice
scorpions are interesting animals to keep in captivity and their habits
under these conditions have been carefully studied by mr pocock[]
when supplied with sand they dig pits in it in which they lie during
the greater part of the day the second and third pairs of legs are used
for this purpose the scorpion raising itself upon the other two pairs
as well as to a certain extent upon the claws and the end of the tail
in this position it kicks the sand backwards from under it and then
when the excavation is sufficiently deep sweeps away the accumulated
heap with its tail so that the edge of its lurking-place is on a level
with the surrounding surface it can thus as it lies there obtain an
uninterrupted view which the better enables it to receive with proper
attention any creature of the requisite size and quality that approaches
its portals such creatures are principally insects spiders
centipedes wood-lice and the like—but here we may remember one little
spider that imitates a scorpion and may therefore approach with
impunity at least if the disparity in size be not too great for whilst
some scorpions are quite small others attain a length of eight or nine
inches with a bulk more than in proportion to their length
in captivity and no doubt under nature too when they happen to come
across them scorpions will eat cockroaches but a cockroach is not
altogether a defenceless creature and sometimes a large one will give
battle and even with success the weapons upon which in these cases
it relies are its powerful hind legs armed as they are with spines
which project backwards backwards accordingly it advances upon the
scorpion and increasing its pace suddenly when at the requisite
distance salutes the astonished enemy with a shower of kicks so
unexpected is this mode of assault that it is sometimes effective even
against so redoubtable an opponent as a scorpion whilst a tarantula
spider has been known to fly panic-stricken before or rather behind a
large cockroach but such efforts however heroic can have only a
transient success where the conditions are so unequal jaws and sting
must prevail against soft bodies armed only with spiny legs “_alla
stoccata_ carries it away” generally the poor cockroach is
seized—sometimes in the first instance by the antennæ—as it comes
inadvertently too near to the scorpion or even trespasses upon its
back at once the tail is bent above it and the fatal sting enters its
body paralysis ensues and would no doubt be quickly followed by death
even were the scorpion thereupon to retire as it is however it is
difficult to say whether the victim dies more of the sting or of being
eaten
from the latter process at any rate there is no recovery as may be
seen in the case of smaller cockroaches upon whom the scorpion from
motives of economy does not always waste its poison it merely when
thus provident holds the contemptible creature in its claws whilst
bringing to bear upon it its two pairs of chelæ or real jaws which act
upon the same principle as those of _galeodes vorax_ if the reader
remember it feeds in a leisurely manner the impatience of the
cockroach not affecting it in the least two hours for a good-sized
one—a _pièce de résistance_—is not considered too long by the scorpion
scorpions it appears use their stings in a very careful deliberate
manner it is not a mere random thrust with them lunged in anywhere
just as the body of an insect happens to come on the contrary they
feel about this body most anxiously with their tail till they have
found a soft spot in it and then introduce their sting in a careful
manner in fact they sting an insect in much the way that isaak walton
impaled a frog upon the hook—“tenderly as if they loved him”—and for the
same class of reason viz to make a workmanlike job of it and not
break their stings against the harder parts of its body for the point
of this weapon is delicate and might get chipped against the hard shards
of a beetle or other such resisting surface
for the same prudent reason the tail is carried aloft over the
scorpion’s back when it walks so that the whole organ but especially
the point of it which is curled round again underneath is preserved
from contact with the outer world the sting or rather the sides of the
poison vesicle just above it are clothed with hairs which are no
doubt delicately tactile and the same may be said of the tail and
various other parts of the body touch indeed is the principal sense
which conveys impressions to the soul of the scorpion sight is
defective and hearing does not seem to exist
no one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century
that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences
greater than man’s and yet as mortal as his own; that as men busied
themselves about their various concerns they were scrutinised and
studied perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might
scrutinise the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of
water with infinite complacency men went to and fro over this globe
about their little affairs serene in their assurance of their empire
over matter it is possible that the infusoria under the microscope do
the same no one gave a thought to the older worlds of space as sources
of human danger or thought of them only to dismiss the idea of life
upon them as impossible or improbable it is curious to recall some of
the mental habits of those departed days at most terrestrial men
fancied there might be other men upon mars perhaps inferior to
themselves and ready to welcome a missionary enterprise yet across the
gulf of space minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the
beasts that perish intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic
regarded this earth with envious eyes and slowly and surely drew their
plans against us and early in the twentieth century came the great
disillusionment
the planet mars i scarcely need remind the reader revolves about the
sun at a mean distance of  miles and the light and heat it
receives from the sun is barely half of that received by this world it
must be if the nebular hypothesis has any truth older than our world;
and long before this earth ceased to be molten life upon its surface
must have begun its course the fact that it is scarcely one seventh of
the volume of the earth must have accelerated its cooling to the
temperature at which life could begin it has air and water and all
that is necessary for the support of animated existence
yet so vain is man and so blinded by his vanity that no writer up to
the very end of the nineteenth century expressed any idea that
intelligent life might have developed there far or indeed at all
beyond its earthly level nor was it generally understood that since
mars is older than our earth with scarcely a quarter of the
superficial area and remoter from the sun it necessarily follows that
it is not only more distant from time’s beginning but nearer its end
the secular cooling that must someday overtake our planet has already
gone far indeed with our neighbour its physical condition is still
largely a mystery but we know now that even in its equatorial region
the midday temperature barely approaches that of our coldest winter
its air is much more attenuated than ours its oceans have shrunk until
they cover but a third of its surface and as its slow seasons change
huge snowcaps gather and melt about either pole and periodically
inundate its temperate zones that last stage of exhaustion which to
us is still incredibly remote has become a present-day problem for the
inhabitants of mars the immediate pressure of necessity has brightened
their intellects enlarged their powers and hardened their hearts and
looking across space with instruments and intelligences such as we
have scarcely dreamed of they see at its nearest distance only
 of miles sunward of them a morning star of hope our own
warmer planet green with vegetation and grey with water with a cloudy
atmosphere eloquent of fertility with glimpses through its drifting
cloud wisps of broad stretches of populous country and narrow
navy-crowded seas
and we men the creatures who inhabit this earth must be to them at
least as alien and lowly as are the monkeys and lemurs to us the
intellectual side of man already admits that life is an incessant
struggle for existence and it would seem that this too is the belief
of the minds upon mars their world is far gone in its cooling and this
world is still crowded with life but crowded only with what they
regard as inferior animals to carry warfare sunward is indeed their
only escape from the destruction that generation after generation
creeps upon them
and before we judge of them too harshly we must remember what ruthless
and utter destruction our own species has wrought not only upon
animals such as the vanished bison and the dodo but upon its inferior
races the tasmanians in spite of their human likeness were entirely
swept out of existence in a war of extermination waged by european
immigrants in the space of fifty years are we such apostles of mercy
as to complain if the martians warred in the same spirit
the martians seem to have calculated their descent with amazing
subtlety—their mathematical learning is evidently far in excess of
ours—and to have carried out their preparations with a well-nigh
perfect unanimity had our instruments permitted it we might have seen
the gathering trouble far back in the nineteenth century men like
schiaparelli watched the red planet—it is odd by-the-bye that for
countless centuries mars has been the star of war—but failed to
interpret the fluctuating appearances of the markings they mapped so
well all that time the martians must have been getting ready
during the opposition of  a great light was seen on the illuminated
part of the disk first at the lick observatory then by perrotin of
nice and then by other observers english readers heard of it first in
the issue of _nature_ dated august  i am inclined to think that this
blaze may have been the casting of the huge gun in the vast pit sunk
into their planet from which their shots were fired at us peculiar
markings as yet unexplained were seen near the site of that outbreak
during the next two oppositions
the storm burst upon us six years ago now as mars approached
opposition lavelle of java set the wires of the astronomical exchange
palpitating with the amazing intelligence of a huge outbreak of
incandescent gas upon the planet it had occurred towards midnight of
the twelfth; and the spectroscope to which he had at once resorted
indicated a mass of flaming gas chiefly hydrogen moving with an
enormous velocity towards this earth this jet of fire had become
invisible about a quarter past twelve he compared it to a colossal
puff of flame suddenly and violently squirted out of the planet “as
flaming gases rushed out of a gun”
a singularly appropriate phrase it proved yet the next day there was
nothing of this in the papers except a little note in the _daily
telegraph_ and the world went in ignorance of one of the gravest
dangers that ever threatened the human race i might not have heard of
the eruption at all had i not met ogilvy the well-known astronomer at
ottershaw he was immensely excited at the news and in the excess of
his feelings invited me up to take a turn with him that night in a
scrutiny of the red planet
in spite of all that has happened since i still remember that vigil
very distinctly: the black and silent observatory the shadowed lantern
throwing a feeble glow upon the floor in the corner the steady ticking
of the clockwork of the telescope the little slit in the roof—an
oblong profundity with the stardust streaked across it ogilvy moved
about invisible but audible looking through the telescope one saw a
circle of deep blue and the little round planet swimming in the field
it seemed such a little thing so bright and small and still faintly
marked with transverse stripes and slightly flattened from the perfect
round but so little it was so silvery warm—a pin’s head of light! it
was as if it quivered but really this was the telescope vibrating with
the activity of the clockwork that kept the planet in view
as i watched the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller and to
advance and recede but that was simply that my eye was tired forty
millions of miles it was from us—more than forty millions of miles of
void few people realise the immensity of vacancy in which the dust of
the material universe swims
near it in the field i remember were three faint points of light
three telescopic stars infinitely remote and all around it was the
unfathomable darkness of empty space you know how that blackness looks
on a frosty starlight night in a telescope it seems far profounder
and invisible to me because it was so remote and small flying swiftly
and steadily towards me across that incredible distance drawing nearer
every minute by so many thousands of miles came the thing they were
sending us the thing that was to bring so much struggle and calamity
and death to the earth i never dreamed of it then as i watched; no one
on earth dreamed of that unerring missile
that night too there was another jetting out of gas from the distant
planet i saw it a reddish flash at the edge the slightest projection
of the outline just as the chronometer struck midnight; and at that i
told ogilvy and he took my place the night was warm and i was thirsty
and i went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the
darkness to the little table where the siphon stood while ogilvy
exclaimed at the streamer of gas that came out towards us
that night another invisible missile started on its way to the earth
from mars just a second or so under twenty-four hours after the first
one i remember how i sat on the table there in the blackness with
patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes i wished i had a
light to smoke by little suspecting the meaning of the minute gleam i
had seen and all that it would presently bring me ogilvy watched till
one and then gave it up; and we lit the lantern and walked over to his
house down below in the darkness were ottershaw and chertsey and all
their hundreds of people sleeping in peace
he was full of speculation that night about the condition of mars and
scoffed at the vulgar idea of its having inhabitants who were
signalling us his idea was that meteorites might be falling in a heavy
shower upon the planet or that a huge volcanic explosion was in
progress he pointed out to me how unlikely it was that organic
evolution had taken the same direction in the two adjacent planets
“the chances against anything manlike on mars are a million to one” he
said
hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after
about midnight and again the night after; and so for ten nights a
flame each night why the shots ceased after the tenth no one on earth
has attempted to explain it may be the gases of the firing caused the
martians inconvenience dense clouds of smoke or dust visible through
a powerful telescope on earth as little grey fluctuating patches
spread through the clearness of the planet’s atmosphere and obscured
its more familiar features
even the daily papers woke up to the disturbances at last and popular
notes appeared here there and everywhere concerning the volcanoes
upon mars the seriocomic periodical _punch_ i remember made a happy
use of it in the political cartoon and all unsuspected those
missiles the martians had fired at us drew earthward rushing now at a
pace of many miles a second through the empty gulf of space hour by
hour and day by day nearer and nearer it seems to me now almost
incredibly wonderful that with that swift fate hanging over us men
could go about their petty concerns as they did i remember how
jubilant markham was at securing a new photograph of the planet for the
illustrated paper he edited in those days people in these latter times
scarcely realise the abundance and enterprise of our nineteenth-century
papers for my own part i was much occupied in learning to ride the
bicycle and busy upon a series of papers discussing the probable
developments of moral ideas as civilisation progressed
one night (the first missile then could scarcely have been 
miles away) i went for a walk with my wife it was starlight and i
explained the signs of the zodiac to her and pointed out mars a
bright dot of light creeping zenithward towards which so many
telescopes were pointed it was a warm night coming home a party of
excursionists from chertsey or isleworth passed us singing and playing
music there were lights in the upper windows of the houses as the
people went to bed from the railway station in the distance came the
sound of shunting trains ringing and rumbling softened almost into
melody by the distance my wife pointed out to me the brightness of the
red green and yellow signal lights hanging in a framework against the
sky it seemed so safe and tranquil
ii
the falling star
then came the night of the first falling star it was seen early in the
morning rushing over winchester eastward a line of flame high in the
atmosphere hundreds must have seen it and taken it for an ordinary
falling star albin described it as leaving a greenish streak behind it
that glowed for some seconds denning our greatest authority on
meteorites stated that the height of its first appearance was about
ninety or one hundred miles it seemed to him that it fell to earth
about one hundred miles east of him
i was at home at that hour and writing in my study; and although my
french windows face towards ottershaw and the blind was up (for i loved
in those days to look up at the night sky) i saw nothing of it yet
this strangest of all things that ever came to earth from outer space
must have fallen while i was sitting there visible to me had i only
looked up as it passed some of those who saw its flight say it
travelled with a hissing sound i myself heard nothing of that many
people in berkshire surrey and middlesex must have seen the fall of
it and at most have thought that another meteorite had descended no
one seems to have troubled to look for the fallen mass that night
but very early in the morning poor ogilvy who had seen the shooting
star and who was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere on the common
between horsell ottershaw and woking rose early with the idea of
finding it find it he did soon after dawn and not far from the
sand-pits an enormous hole had been made by the impact of the
projectile and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every
direction over the heath forming heaps visible a mile and a half away
the heather was on fire eastward and a thin blue smoke rose against
the dawn
the thing itself lay almost entirely buried in sand amidst the
scattered splinters of a fir tree it had shivered to fragments in its
descent the uncovered part had the appearance of a huge cylinder
caked over and its outline softened by a thick scaly dun-coloured
incrustation it had a diameter of about thirty yards he approached
the mass surprised at the size and more so at the shape since most
meteorites are rounded more or less completely it was however still
so hot from its flight through the air as to forbid his near approach
a stirring noise within its cylinder he ascribed to the unequal cooling
of its surface; for at that time it had not occurred to him that it
might be hollow
he remained standing at the edge of the pit that the thing had made for
itself staring at its strange appearance astonished chiefly at its
unusual shape and colour and dimly perceiving even then some evidence
of design in its arrival the early morning was wonderfully still and
the sun just clearing the pine trees towards weybridge was already
warm he did not remember hearing any birds that morning there was
certainly no breeze stirring and the only sounds were the faint
movements from within the cindery cylinder he was all alone on the
common
then suddenly he noticed with a start that some of the grey clinker
the ashy incrustation that covered the meteorite was falling off the
circular edge of the end it was dropping off in flakes and raining
down upon the sand a large piece suddenly came off and fell with a
sharp noise that brought his heart into his mouth
for a minute he scarcely realised what this meant and although the
heat was excessive he clambered down into the pit close to the bulk to
see the thing more clearly he fancied even then that the cooling of
the body might account for this but what disturbed that idea was the
fact that the ash was falling only from the end of the cylinder
and then he perceived that very slowly the circular top of the
cylinder was rotating on its body it was such a gradual movement that
he discovered it only through noticing that a black mark that had been
near him five minutes ago was now at the other side of the
circumference even then he scarcely understood what this indicated
until he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk
forward an inch or so then the thing came upon him in a flash the
cylinder was artificial—hollow—with an end that screwed out! something
within the cylinder was unscrewing the top!
“good heavens!” said ogilvy “there’s a man in it—men in it! half
roasted to death! trying to escape!”
at once with a quick mental leap he linked the thing with the flash
upon mars
the thought of the confined creature was so dreadful to him that he
forgot the heat and went forward to the cylinder to help turn but
luckily the dull radiation arrested him before he could burn his hands
on the still-glowing metal at that he stood irresolute for a moment
then turned scrambled out of the pit and set off running wildly into
woking the time then must have been somewhere about six o’clock he
met a waggoner and tried to make him understand but the tale he told
and his appearance were so wild—his hat had fallen off in the pit—that
the man simply drove on he was equally unsuccessful with the potman
who was just unlocking the doors of the public-house by horsell bridge
the fellow thought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful
attempt to shut him into the taproom that sobered him a little; and
when he saw henderson the london journalist in his garden he called
over the palings and made himself understood
“henderson” he called “you saw that shooting star last night”
“well” said henderson
“it’s out on horsell common now”
“good lord!” said henderson “fallen meteorite! that’s good”
“but it’s something more than a meteorite it’s a cylinder—an
artificial cylinder man! and there’s something inside”
henderson stood up with his spade in his hand
“what’s that” he said he was deaf in one ear
ogilvy told him all that he had seen henderson was a minute or so
taking it in then he dropped his spade snatched up his jacket and
came out into the road the two men hurried back at once to the common
and found the cylinder still lying in the same position but now the
sounds inside had ceased and a thin circle of bright metal showed
between the top and the body of the cylinder air was either entering
or escaping at the rim with a thin sizzling sound
they listened rapped on the scaly burnt metal with a stick and
meeting with no response they both concluded the man or men inside
must be insensible or dead
of course the two were quite unable to do anything they shouted
consolation and promises and went off back to the town again to get
help one can imagine them covered with sand excited and disordered
running up the little street in the bright sunlight just as the shop
folks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their
bedroom windows henderson went into the railway station at once in
order to telegraph the news to london the newspaper articles had
prepared men’s minds for the reception of the idea
by eight o’clock a number of boys and unemployed men had already
started for the common to see the “dead men from mars” that was the
form the story took i heard of it first from my newspaper boy about a
quarter to nine when i went out to get my _daily chronicle_ i was
naturally startled and lost no time in going out and across the
ottershaw bridge to the sand-pits
iii
on horsell common
i found a little crowd of perhaps twenty people surrounding the huge
hole in which the cylinder lay i have already described the appearance
of that colossal bulk embedded in the ground the turf and gravel
about it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion no doubt its
impact had caused a flash of fire henderson and ogilvy were not there
i think they perceived that nothing was to be done for the present and
had gone away to breakfast at henderson’s house
there were four or five boys sitting on the edge of the pit with their
feet dangling and amusing themselves—until i stopped them—by throwing
stones at the giant mass after i had spoken to them about it they
began playing at “touch” in and out of the group of bystanders
among these were a couple of cyclists a jobbing gardener i employed
sometimes a girl carrying a baby gregg the butcher and his little
boy and two or three loafers and golf caddies who were accustomed to
hang about the railway station there was very little talking few of
the common people in england had anything but the vaguest astronomical
ideas in those days most of them were staring quietly at the big table
like end of the cylinder which was still as ogilvy and henderson had
left it i fancy the popular expectation of a heap of charred corpses
was disappointed at this inanimate bulk some went away while i was
there and other people came i clambered into the pit and fancied i
heard a faint movement under my feet the top had certainly ceased to
rotate
it was only when i got thus close to it that the strangeness of this
object was at all evident to me at the first glance it was really no
more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the
road not so much so indeed it looked like a rusty gas float it
required a certain amount of scientific education to perceive that the
grey scale of the thing was no common oxide that the yellowish-white
metal that gleamed in the crack between the lid and the cylinder had an
unfamiliar hue “extra-terrestrial” had no meaning for most of the
onlookers
at that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the thing had come
from the planet mars but i judged it improbable that it contained any
living creature i thought the unscrewing might be automatic in spite
of ogilvy i still believed that there were men in mars my mind ran
fancifully on the possibilities of its containing manuscript on the
difficulties in translation that might arise whether we should find
coins and models in it and so forth yet it was a little too large for
assurance on this idea i felt an impatience to see it opened about
eleven as nothing seemed happening i walked back full of such
thought to my home in maybury but i found it difficult to get to work
upon my abstract investigations
in the afternoon the appearance of the common had altered very much
the early editions of the evening papers had startled london with
enormous headlines:
“a message received from mars”
“remarkable story from woking”
and so forth in addition ogilvy’s wire to the astronomical exchange
had roused every observatory in the three kingdoms
there were half a dozen flys or more from the woking station standing
in the road by the sand-pits a basket-chaise from chobham and a
rather lordly carriage besides that there was quite a heap of
bicycles in addition a large number of people must have walked in
spite of the heat of the day from woking and chertsey so that there
was altogether quite a considerable crowd—one or two gaily dressed
ladies among the others
it was glaringly hot not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind and
the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees the burning
heather had been extinguished but the level ground towards ottershaw
was blackened as far as one could see and still giving off vertical
streamers of smoke an enterprising sweet-stuff dealer in the chobham
road had sent up his son with a barrow-load of green apples and ginger
beer
going to the edge of the pit i found it occupied by a group of about
half a dozen men—henderson ogilvy and a tall fair-haired man that i
afterwards learned was stent the astronomer royal with several
workmen wielding spades and pickaxes stent was giving directions in a
clear high-pitched voice he was standing on the cylinder which was
now evidently much cooler; his face was crimson and streaming with
perspiration and something seemed to have irritated him
a large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered though its lower
end was still embedded as soon as ogilvy saw me among the staring
crowd on the edge of the pit he called to me to come down and asked me
if i would mind going over to see lord hilton the lord of the manor
the growing crowd he said was becoming a serious impediment to their
excavations especially the boys they wanted a light railing put up
and help to keep the people back he told me that a faint stirring was
occasionally still audible within the case but that the workmen had
failed to unscrew the top as it afforded no grip to them the case
appeared to be enormously thick and it was possible that the faint
sounds we heard represented a noisy tumult in the interior
i was very glad to do as he asked and so become one of the privileged
spectators within the contemplated enclosure i failed to find lord
hilton at his house but i was told he was expected from london by the
six o’clock train from waterloo; and as it was then about a quarter
past five i went home had some tea and walked up to the station to
waylay him
iv
the cylinder opens
when i returned to the common the sun was setting scattered groups
were hurrying from the direction of woking and one or two persons were
returning the crowd about the pit had increased and stood out black
against the lemon yellow of the sky—a couple of hundred people
perhaps there were raised voices and some sort of struggle appeared
to be going on about the pit strange imaginings passed through my
mind as i drew nearer i heard stent’s voice:
“keep back! keep back!”
a boy came running towards me
“it’s a-movin’” he said to me as he passed; “a-screwin’ and a-screwin’
out i don’t like it i’m a-goin’ ’ome i am”
i went on to the crowd there were really i should think two or three
hundred people elbowing and jostling one another the one or two ladies
there being by no means the least active
“he’s fallen in the pit!” cried some one
“keep back!” said several
the crowd swayed a little and i elbowed my way through every one
seemed greatly excited i heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit
“i say!” said ogilvy; “help keep these idiots back we don’t know
what’s in the confounded thing you know!”
i saw a young man a shop assistant in woking i believe he was
standing on the cylinder and trying to scramble out of the hole again
the crowd had pushed him in
the end of the cylinder was being screwed out from within nearly two
feet of shining screw projected somebody blundered against me and i
narrowly missed being pitched onto the top of the screw i turned and
as i did so the screw must have come out for the lid of the cylinder
fell upon the gravel with a ringing concussion i stuck my elbow into
the person behind me and turned my head towards the thing again for a
moment that circular cavity seemed perfectly black i had the sunset in
my eyes
i think everyone expected to see a man emerge—possibly something a
little unlike us terrestrial men but in all essentials a man i know i
did but looking i presently saw something stirring within the
shadow: greyish billowy movements one above another and then two
luminous disks—like eyes then something resembling a little grey
snake about the thickness of a walking stick coiled up out of the
writhing middle and wriggled in the air towards me—and then another
a sudden chill came over me there was a loud shriek from a woman
behind i half turned keeping my eyes fixed upon the cylinder still
from which other tentacles were now projecting and began pushing my
way back from the edge of the pit i saw astonishment giving place to
horror on the faces of the people about me i heard inarticulate
exclamations on all sides there was a general movement backwards i
saw the shopman struggling still on the edge of the pit i found myself
alone and saw the people on the other side of the pit running off
stent among them i looked again at the cylinder and ungovernable
terror gripped me i stood petrified and staring
a big greyish rounded bulk the size perhaps of a bear was rising
slowly and painfully out of the cylinder as it bulged up and caught
the light it glistened like wet leather
two large dark-coloured eyes were regarding me steadfastly the mass
that framed them the head of the thing was rounded and had one
might say a face there was a mouth under the eyes the lipless brim
of which quivered and panted and dropped saliva the whole creature
heaved and pulsated convulsively a lank tentacular appendage gripped
the edge of the cylinder another swayed in the air
those who have never seen a living martian can scarcely imagine the
strange horror of its appearance the peculiar v-shaped mouth with its
pointed upper lip the absence of brow ridges the absence of a chin
beneath the wedgelike lower lip the incessant quivering of this mouth
the gorgon groups of tentacles the tumultuous breathing of the lungs
in a strange atmosphere the evident heaviness and painfulness of
movement due to the greater gravitational energy of the earth—above
all the extraordinary intensity of the immense eyes—were at once
vital intense inhuman crippled and monstrous there was something
fungoid in the oily brown skin something in the clumsy deliberation of
the tedious movements unspeakably nasty even at this first encounter
this first glimpse i was overcome with disgust and dread
suddenly the monster vanished it had toppled over the brim of the
cylinder and fallen into the pit with a thud like the fall of a great
mass of leather i heard it give a peculiar thick cry and forthwith
another of these creatures appeared darkly in the deep shadow of the
aperture
i turned and running madly made for the first group of trees perhaps
a hundred yards away; but i ran slantingly and stumbling for i could
not avert my face from these things
there among some young pine trees and furze bushes i stopped
panting and waited further developments the common round the
sand-pits was dotted with people standing like myself in a
half-fascinated terror staring at these creatures or rather at the
heaped gravel at the edge of the pit in which they lay and then with
a renewed horror i saw a round black object bobbing up and down on
the edge of the pit it was the head of the shopman who had fallen in
but showing as a little black object against the hot western sun now
he got his shoulder and knee up and again he seemed to slip back until
only his head was visible suddenly he vanished and i could have
fancied a faint shriek had reached me i had a momentary impulse to go
back and help him that my fears overruled
everything was then quite invisible hidden by the deep pit and the
heap of sand that the fall of the cylinder had made anyone coming
along the road from chobham or woking would have been amazed at the
sight—a dwindling multitude of perhaps a hundred people or more
standing in a great irregular circle in ditches behind bushes behind
gates and hedges saying little to one another and that in short
excited shouts and staring staring hard at a few heaps of sand the
barrow of ginger beer stood a queer derelict black against the
burning sky and in the sand-pits was a row of deserted vehicles with
their horses feeding out of nosebags or pawing the ground
v
the heat-ray
after the glimpse i had had of the martians emerging from the cylinder
in which they had come to the earth from their planet a kind of
fascination paralysed my actions i remained standing knee-deep in the
heather staring at the mound that hid them i was a battleground of
fear and curiosity
i did not dare to go back towards the pit but i felt a passionate
longing to peer into it i began walking therefore in a big curve
seeking some point of vantage and continually looking at the sand-heaps
that hid these new-comers to our earth once a leash of thin black
whips like the arms of an octopus flashed across the sunset and was
immediately withdrawn and afterwards a thin rod rose up joint by
joint bearing at its apex a circular disk that spun with a wobbling
motion what could be going on there
most of the spectators had gathered in one or two groups—one a little
crowd towards woking the other a knot of people in the direction of
chobham evidently they shared my mental conflict there were few near
me one man i approached—he was i perceived a neighbour of mine
though i did not know his name—and accosted but it was scarcely a time
for articulate conversation
“what ugly _brutes_!” he said “good god! what ugly brutes!” he
repeated this over and over again
“did you see a man in the pit” i said; but he made no answer to that
we became silent and stood watching for a time side by side deriving
i fancy a certain comfort in one another’s company then i shifted my
position to a little knoll that gave me the advantage of a yard or more
of elevation and when i looked for him presently he was walking towards
woking
the sunset faded to twilight before anything further happened the
crowd far away on the left towards woking seemed to grow and i heard
now a faint murmur from it the little knot of people towards chobham
dispersed there was scarcely an intimation of movement from the pit
it was this as much as anything that gave people courage and i
suppose the new arrivals from woking also helped to restore confidence
at any rate as the dusk came on a slow intermittent movement upon the
sand-pits began a movement that seemed to gather force as the
stillness of the evening about the cylinder remained unbroken vertical
black figures in twos and threes would advance stop watch and
advance again spreading out as they did so in a thin irregular
crescent that promised to enclose the pit in its attenuated horns i
too on my side began to move towards the pit
then i saw some cabmen and others had walked boldly into the sand-pits
and heard the clatter of hoofs and the gride of wheels i saw a lad
trundling off the barrow of apples and then within thirty yards of
the pit advancing from the direction of horsell i noted a little
black knot of men the foremost of whom was waving a white flag
this was the deputation there had been a hasty consultation and since
the martians were evidently in spite of their repulsive forms
intelligent creatures it had been resolved to show them by
approaching them with signals that we too were intelligent
flutter flutter went the flag first to the right then to the left
it was too far for me to recognise anyone there but afterwards i
learned that ogilvy stent and henderson were with others in this
attempt at communication this little group had in its advance dragged
inward so to speak the circumference of the now almost complete
circle of people and a number of dim black figures followed it at
discreet distances
suddenly there was a flash of light and a quantity of luminous
greenish smoke came out of the pit in three distinct puffs which drove
up one after the other straight into the still air
this smoke (or flame perhaps would be the better word for it) was so
bright that the deep blue sky overhead and the hazy stretches of brown
common towards chertsey set with black pine trees seemed to darken
abruptly as these puffs arose and to remain the darker after their
dispersal at the same time a faint hissing sound became audible
beyond the pit stood the little wedge of people with the white flag at
its apex arrested by these phenomena a little knot of small vertical
black shapes upon the black ground as the green smoke arose their
faces flashed out pallid green and faded again as it vanished then
slowly the hissing passed into a humming into a long loud droning
noise slowly a humped shape rose out of the pit and the ghost of a
beam of light seemed to flicker out from it
forthwith flashes of actual flame a bright glare leaping from one to
another sprang from the scattered group of men it was as if some
invisible jet impinged upon them and flashed into white flame it was
as if each man were suddenly and momentarily turned to fire
then by the light of their own destruction i saw them staggering and
falling and their supporters turning to run
i stood staring not as yet realising that this was death leaping from
man to man in that little distant crowd all i felt was that it was
something very strange an almost noiseless and blinding flash of
light and a man fell headlong and lay still; and as the unseen shaft
of heat passed over them pine trees burst into fire and every dry
furze bush became with one dull thud a mass of flames and far away
towards knaphill i saw the flashes of trees and hedges and wooden
buildings suddenly set alight
it was sweeping round swiftly and steadily this flaming death this
invisible inevitable sword of heat i perceived it coming towards me
by the flashing bushes it touched and was too astounded and stupefied
to stir i heard the crackle of fire in the sand-pits and the sudden
squeal of a horse that was as suddenly stilled then it was as if an
invisible yet intensely heated finger were drawn through the heather
between me and the martians and all along a curving line beyond the
sand-pits the dark ground smoked and crackled something fell with a
crash far away to the left where the road from woking station opens out
on the common forth-with the hissing and humming ceased and the
black dome-like object sank slowly out of sight into the pit
all this had happened with such swiftness that i had stood motionless
dumbfounded and dazzled by the flashes of light had that death swept
through a full circle it must inevitably have slain me in my surprise
but it passed and spared me and left the night about me suddenly dark
and unfamiliar
the undulating common seemed now dark almost to blackness except where
its roadways lay grey and pale under the deep blue sky of the early
night it was dark and suddenly void of men overhead the stars were
mustering and in the west the sky was still a pale bright almost
greenish blue the tops of the pine trees and the roofs of horsell came
out sharp and black against the western afterglow the martians and
their appliances were altogether invisible save for that thin mast
upon which their restless mirror wobbled patches of bush and isolated
trees here and there smoked and glowed still and the houses towards
woking station were sending up spires of flame into the stillness of
the evening air
nothing was changed save for that and a terrible astonishment the
little group of black specks with the flag of white had been swept out
of existence and the stillness of the evening so it seemed to me had
scarcely been broken
it came to me that i was upon this dark common helpless unprotected
and alone suddenly like a thing falling upon me from without
came—fear
with an effort i turned and began a stumbling run through the heather
the fear i felt was no rational fear but a panic terror not only of
the martians but of the dusk and stillness all about me such an
extraordinary effect in unmanning me it had that i ran weeping silently
as a child might do once i had turned i did not dare to look back
i remember i felt an extraordinary persuasion that i was being played
with that presently when i was upon the very verge of safety this
mysterious death—as swift as the passage of light—would leap after me
from the pit about the cylinder and strike me down
vi
the heat-ray in the chobham road
it is still a matter of wonder how the martians are able to slay men so
swiftly and so silently many think that in some way they are able to
generate an intense heat in a chamber of practically absolute
non-conductivity this intense heat they project in a parallel beam
against any object they choose by means of a polished parabolic mirror
of unknown composition much as the parabolic mirror of a lighthouse
projects a beam of light but no one has absolutely proved these
details however it is done it is certain that a beam of heat is the
essence of the matter heat and invisible instead of visible light
whatever is combustible flashes into flame at its touch lead runs like
water it softens iron cracks and melts glass and when it falls upon
water incontinently that explodes into steam
that night nearly forty people lay under the starlight about the pit
charred and distorted beyond recognition and all night long the common
from horsell to maybury was deserted and brightly ablaze
the news of the massacre probably reached chobham woking and
ottershaw about the same time in woking the shops had closed when the
tragedy happened and a number of people shop people and so forth
attracted by the stories they had heard were walking over the horsell
bridge and along the road between the hedges that runs out at last upon
the common you may imagine the young people brushed up after the
labours of the day and making this novelty as they would make any
novelty the excuse for walking together and enjoying a trivial
flirtation you may figure to yourself the hum of voices along the road
in the gloaming   
as yet of course few people in woking even knew that the cylinder had
opened though poor henderson had sent a messenger on a bicycle to the
post office with a special wire to an evening paper
as these folks came out by twos and threes upon the open they found
little knots of people talking excitedly and peering at the spinning
mirror over the sand-pits and the newcomers were no doubt soon
infected by the excitement of the occasion
by half past eight when the deputation was destroyed there may have
been a crowd of three hundred people or more at this place besides
those who had left the road to approach the martians nearer there were
three policemen too one of whom was mounted doing their best under
instructions from stent to keep the people back and deter them from
approaching the cylinder there was some booing from those more
thoughtless and excitable souls to whom a crowd is always an occasion
for noise and horse-play
stent and ogilvy anticipating some possibilities of a collision had
telegraphed from horsell to the barracks as soon as the martians
emerged for the help of a company of soldiers to protect these strange
creatures from violence after that they returned to lead that
ill-fated advance the description of their death as it was seen by
the crowd tallies very closely with my own impressions: the three
puffs of green smoke the deep humming note and the flashes of flame
but that crowd of people had a far narrower escape than mine only the
fact that a hummock of heathery sand intercepted the lower part of the
heat-ray saved them had the elevation of the parabolic mirror been a
few yards higher none could have lived to tell the tale they saw the
flashes and the men falling and an invisible hand as it were lit the
bushes as it hurried towards them through the twilight then with a
whistling note that rose above the droning of the pit the beam swung
close over their heads lighting the tops of the beech trees that line
the road and splitting the bricks smashing the windows firing the
window frames and bringing down in crumbling ruin a portion of the
gable of the house nearest the corner
in the sudden thud hiss and glare of the igniting trees the
panic-stricken crowd seems to have swayed hesitatingly for some
moments sparks and burning twigs began to fall into the road and
single leaves like puffs of flame hats and dresses caught fire then
came a crying from the common there were shrieks and shouts and
suddenly a mounted policeman came galloping through the confusion with
his hands clasped over his head screaming
“they’re coming!” a woman shrieked and incontinently everyone was
turning and pushing at those behind in order to clear their way to
woking again they must have bolted as blindly as a flock of sheep
where the road grows narrow and black between the high banks the crowd
jammed and a desperate struggle occurred all that crowd did not
escape; three persons at least two women and a little boy were
crushed and trampled there and left to die amid the terror and the
darkness
vii
how i reached home
for my own part i remember nothing of my flight except the stress of
blundering against trees and stumbling through the heather all about
me gathered the invisible terrors of the martians; that pitiless sword
of heat seemed whirling to and fro flourishing overhead before it
descended and smote me out of life i came into the road between the
crossroads and horsell and ran along this to the crossroads
at last i could go no further; i was exhausted with the violence of my
emotion and of my flight and i staggered and fell by the wayside that
was near the bridge that crosses the canal by the gasworks i fell and
lay still
i must have remained there some time
i sat up strangely perplexed for a moment perhaps i could not
clearly understand how i came there my terror had fallen from me like
a garment my hat had gone and my collar had burst away from its
fastener a few minutes before there had only been three real things
before me—the immensity of the night and space and nature my own
feebleness and anguish and the near approach of death now it was as
if something turned over and the point of view altered abruptly there
was no sensible transition from one state of mind to the other i was
immediately the self of every day again—a decent ordinary citizen the
silent common the impulse of my flight the starting flames were as
if they had been in a dream i asked myself had these latter things
indeed happened i could not credit it
i rose and walked unsteadily up the steep incline of the bridge my
mind was blank wonder my muscles and nerves seemed drained of their
strength i dare say i staggered drunkenly a head rose over the arch
and the figure of a workman carrying a basket appeared beside him ran
a little boy he passed me wishing me good night i was minded to
speak to him but did not i answered his greeting with a meaningless
mumble and went on over the bridge
over the maybury arch a train a billowing tumult of white firelit
smoke and a long caterpillar of lighted windows went flying
south—clatter clatter clap rap and it had gone a dim group of
people talked in the gate of one of the houses in the pretty little row
of gables that was called oriental terrace it was all so real and so
familiar and that behind me! it was frantic fantastic! such things i
told myself could not be
perhaps i am a man of exceptional moods i do not know how far my
experience is common at times i suffer from the strangest sense of
detachment from myself and the world about me; i seem to watch it all
from the outside from somewhere inconceivably remote out of time out
of space out of the stress and tragedy of it all this feeling was
very strong upon me that night here was another side to my dream
but the trouble was the blank incongruity of this serenity and the
swift death flying yonder not two miles away there was a noise of
business from the gasworks and the electric lamps were all alight i
stopped at the group of people
“what news from the common” said i
there were two men and a woman at the gate
“eh” said one of the men turning
“what news from the common” i said
“ain’t yer just _been_ there” asked the men
“people seem fair silly about the common” said the woman over the
gate “what’s it all abart”
“haven’t you heard of the men from mars” said i; “the creatures from
mars”
“quite enough” said the woman over the gate “thenks”; and all three
of them laughed
i felt foolish and angry i tried and found i could not tell them what
i had seen they laughed again at my broken sentences
“you’ll hear more yet” i said and went on to my home
i startled my wife at the doorway so haggard was i i went into the
dining room sat down drank some wine and so soon as i could collect
myself sufficiently i told her the things i had seen the dinner which
was a cold one had already been served and remained neglected on the
table while i told my story
“there is one thing” i said to allay the fears i had aroused; “they
are the most sluggish things i ever saw crawl they may keep the pit
and kill people who come near them but they cannot get out of it  
 but the horror of them!”
“don’t dear!” said my wife knitting her brows and putting her hand on
mine
“poor ogilvy!” i said “to think he may be lying dead there!”
my wife at least did not find my experience incredible when i saw how
deadly white her face was i ceased abruptly
“they may come here” she said again and again
i pressed her to take wine and tried to reassure her
“they can scarcely move” i said
i began to comfort her and myself by repeating all that ogilvy had told
me of the impossibility of the martians establishing themselves on the
earth in particular i laid stress on the gravitational difficulty on
the surface of the earth the force of gravity is three times what it is
on the surface of mars a martian therefore would weigh three times
more than on mars albeit his muscular strength would be the same his
own body would be a cope of lead to him therefore that indeed was
the general opinion both _the times_ and the _daily telegraph_ for
instance insisted on it the next morning and both overlooked just as
i did two obvious modifying influences
the atmosphere of the earth we now know contains far more oxygen or
far less argon (whichever way one likes to put it) than does mars’ the
invigorating influences of this excess of oxygen upon the martians
indisputably did much to counterbalance the increased weight of their
bodies and in the second place we all overlooked the fact that such
mechanical intelligence as the martian possessed was quite able to
dispense with muscular exertion at a pinch
but i did not consider these points at the time and so my reasoning
was dead against the chances of the invaders with wine and food the
confidence of my own table and the necessity of reassuring my wife i
grew by insensible degrees courageous and secure
“they have done a foolish thing” said i fingering my wineglass “they
are dangerous because no doubt they are mad with terror perhaps they
expected to find no living things—certainly no intelligent living
things”
“a shell in the pit” said i “if the worst comes to the worst will
kill them all”
the intense excitement of the events had no doubt left my perceptive
powers in a state of erethism i remember that dinner table with
extraordinary vividness even now my dear wife’s sweet anxious face
peering at me from under the pink lamp shade the white cloth with its
silver and glass table furniture—for in those days even philosophical
writers had many little luxuries—the crimson-purple wine in my glass
are photographically distinct at the end of it i sat tempering nuts
with a cigarette regretting ogilvy’s rashness and denouncing the
short-sighted timidity of the martians
so some respectable dodo in the mauritius might have lorded it in his
nest and discussed the arrival of that shipful of pitiless sailors in
want of animal food “we will peck them to death tomorrow my dear”
i did not know it but that was the last civilised dinner i was to eat
for very many strange and terrible days
viii
friday night
the most extraordinary thing to my mind of all the strange and
wonderful things that happened upon that friday was the dovetailing of
the commonplace habits of our social order with the first beginnings of
the series of events that was to topple that social order headlong if
on friday night you had taken a pair of compasses and drawn a circle
with a radius of five miles round the woking sand-pits i doubt if you
would have had one human being outside it unless it were some relation
of stent or of the three or four cyclists or london people lying dead
on the common whose emotions or habits were at all affected by the
new-comers many people had heard of the cylinder of course and
talked about it in their leisure but it certainly did not make the
sensation that an ultimatum to germany would have done
in london that night poor henderson’s telegram describing the gradual
unscrewing of the shot was judged to be a canard and his evening
paper after wiring for authentication from him and receiving no
reply—the man was killed—decided not to print a special edition
even within the five-mile circle the great majority of people were
inert i have already described the behaviour of the men and women to
whom i spoke all over the district people were dining and supping;
working men were gardening after the labours of the day children were
being put to bed young people were wandering through the lanes
love-making students sat over their books
maybe there was a murmur in the village streets a novel and dominant
topic in the public-houses and here and there a messenger or even an
eye-witness of the later occurrences caused a whirl of excitement a
shouting and a running to and fro; but for the most part the daily
routine of working eating drinking sleeping went on as it had done
for countless years—as though no planet mars existed in the sky even
at woking station and horsell and chobham that was the case
in woking junction until a late hour trains were stopping and going
on others were shunting on the sidings passengers were alighting and
waiting and everything was proceeding in the most ordinary way a boy
from the town trenching on smith’s monopoly was selling papers with
the afternoon’s news the ringing impact of trucks the sharp whistle
of the engines from the junction mingled with their shouts of “men
from mars!” excited men came into the station about nine o’clock with
incredible tidings and caused no more disturbance than drunkards might
have done people rattling londonwards peered into the darkness outside
the carriage windows and saw only a rare flickering vanishing spark
dance up from the direction of horsell a red glow and a thin veil of
smoke driving across the stars and thought that nothing more serious
than a heath fire was happening it was only round the edge of the
common that any disturbance was perceptible there were half a dozen
villas burning on the woking border there were lights in all the
houses on the common side of the three villages and the people there
kept awake till dawn
a curious crowd lingered restlessly people coming and going but the
crowd remaining both on the chobham and horsell bridges one or two
adventurous souls it was afterwards found went into the darkness and
crawled quite near the martians; but they never returned for now and
again a light-ray like the beam of a warship’s searchlight swept the
common and the heat-ray was ready to follow save for such that big
area of common was silent and desolate and the charred bodies lay
about on it all night under the stars and all the next day a noise of
hammering from the pit was heard by many people
so you have the state of things on friday night in the centre
sticking into the skin of our old planet earth like a poisoned dart
was this cylinder but the poison was scarcely working yet around it
was a patch of silent common smouldering in places and with a few
dark dimly seen objects lying in contorted attitudes here and there
here and there was a burning bush or tree beyond was a fringe of
excitement and farther than that fringe the inflammation had not crept
as yet in the rest of the world the stream of life still flowed as it
had flowed for immemorial years the fever of war that would presently
clog vein and artery deaden nerve and destroy brain had still to
develop
all night long the martians were hammering and stirring sleepless
indefatigable at work upon the machines they were making ready and
ever and again a puff of greenish-white smoke whirled up to the starlit
sky
about eleven a company of soldiers came through horsell and deployed
along the edge of the common to form a cordon later a second company
marched through chobham to deploy on the north side of the common
several officers from the inkerman barracks had been on the common
earlier in the day and one major eden was reported to be missing
the colonel of the regiment came to the chobham bridge and was busy
questioning the crowd at midnight the military authorities were
certainly alive to the seriousness of the business about eleven the
next morning’s papers were able to say a squadron of hussars two
maxims and about four hundred men of the cardigan regiment started
from aldershot
a few seconds after midnight the crowd in the chertsey road woking
saw a star fall from heaven into the pine woods to the northwest it
had a greenish colour and caused a silent brightness like summer
lightning this was the second cylinder
ix
the fighting begins
saturday lives in my memory as a day of suspense it was a day of
lassitude too hot and close with i am told a rapidly fluctuating
barometer i had slept but little though my wife had succeeded in
sleeping and i rose early i went into my garden before breakfast and
stood listening but towards the common there was nothing stirring but
a lark
the milkman came as usual i heard the rattle of his chariot and i went
round to the side gate to ask the latest news he told me that during
the night the martians had been surrounded by troops and that guns
were expected then—a familiar reassuring note—i heard a train running
towards woking
“they aren’t to be killed” said the milkman “if that can possibly be
avoided”
i saw my neighbour gardening chatted with him for a time and then
strolled in to breakfast it was a most unexceptional morning my
neighbour was of opinion that the troops would be able to capture or to
destroy the martians during the day
“it’s a pity they make themselves so unapproachable” he said “it
would be curious to know how they live on another planet; we might
learn a thing or two”
he came up to the fence and extended a handful of strawberries for his
gardening was as generous as it was enthusiastic at the same time he
told me of the burning of the pine woods about the byfleet golf links
“they say” said he “that there’s another of those blessed things
fallen there—number two but one’s enough surely this lot’ll cost the
insurance people a pretty penny before everything’s settled” he
laughed with an air of the greatest good humour as he said this the
woods he said were still burning and pointed out a haze of smoke to
me “they will be hot under foot for days on account of the thick soil
of pine needles and turf” he said and then grew serious over “poor
ogilvy”
after breakfast instead of working i decided to walk down towards the
common under the railway bridge i found a group of soldiers—sappers i
think men in small round caps dirty red jackets unbuttoned and
showing their blue shirts dark trousers and boots coming to the calf
they told me no one was allowed over the canal and looking along the
road towards the bridge i saw one of the cardigan men standing
sentinel there i talked with these soldiers for a time; i told them of
my sight of the martians on the previous evening none of them had seen
the martians and they had but the vaguest ideas of them so that they
plied me with questions they said that they did not know who had
authorised the movements of the troops; their idea was that a dispute
had arisen at the horse guards the ordinary sapper is a great deal
better educated than the common soldier and they discussed the
peculiar conditions of the possible fight with some acuteness i
described the heat-ray to them and they began to argue among
themselves
“crawl up under cover and rush ’em say i” said one
“get aht!” said another “what’s cover against this ’ere ’eat sticks
to cook yer! what we got to do is to go as near as the ground’ll let
us and then drive a trench”
“blow yer trenches! you always want trenches; you ought to ha’ been
born a rabbit snippy”
“ain’t they got any necks then” said a third abruptly—a little
contemplative dark man smoking a pipe
i repeated my description
“octopuses” said he “that’s what i calls ’em talk about fishers of
men—fighters of fish it is this time!”
“it ain’t no murder killing beasts like that” said the first speaker
“why not shell the darned things strite off and finish ’em” said the
little dark man “you carn tell what they might do”
“where’s your shells” said the first speaker “there ain’t no time do
it in a rush that’s my tip and do it at once”
so they discussed it after a while i left them and went on to the
railway station to get as many morning papers as i could
but i will not weary the reader with a description of that long morning
and of the longer afternoon i did not succeed in getting a glimpse of
the common for even horsell and chobham church towers were in the
hands of the military authorities the soldiers i addressed didn’t know
anything; the officers were mysterious as well as busy i found people
in the town quite secure again in the presence of the military and i
heard for the first time from marshall the tobacconist that his son
was among the dead on the common the soldiers had made the people on
the outskirts of horsell lock up and leave their houses
i got back to lunch about two very tired for as i have said the day
was extremely hot and dull; and in order to refresh myself i took a
cold bath in the afternoon about half past four i went up to the
railway station to get an evening paper for the morning papers had
contained only a very inaccurate description of the killing of stent
henderson ogilvy and the others but there was little i didn’t know
the martians did not show an inch of themselves they seemed busy in
their pit and there was a sound of hammering and an almost continuous
streamer of smoke apparently they were busy getting ready for a
struggle “fresh attempts have been made to signal but without
success” was the stereotyped formula of the papers a sapper told me
it was done by a man in a ditch with a flag on a long pole the
martians took as much notice of such advances as we should of the
lowing of a cow
i must confess the sight of all this armament all this preparation
greatly excited me my imagination became belligerent and defeated the
invaders in a dozen striking ways; something of my schoolboy dreams of
battle and heroism came back it hardly seemed a fair fight to me at
that time they seemed very helpless in that pit of theirs
about three o’clock there began the thud of a gun at measured intervals
from chertsey or addlestone i learned that the smouldering pine wood
into which the second cylinder had fallen was being shelled in the
hope of destroying that object before it opened it was only about
five however that a field gun reached chobham for use against the
first body of martians
about six in the evening as i sat at tea with my wife in the
summerhouse talking vigorously about the battle that was lowering upon
us i heard a muffled detonation from the common and immediately after
a gust of firing close on the heels of that came a violent rattling
crash quite close to us that shook the ground; and starting out upon
the lawn i saw the tops of the trees about the oriental college burst
into smoky red flame and the tower of the little church beside it
slide down into ruin the pinnacle of the mosque had vanished and the
roof line of the college itself looked as if a hundred-ton gun had been
at work upon it one of our chimneys cracked as if a shot had hit it
flew and a piece of it came clattering down the tiles and made a heap
of broken red fragments upon the flower bed by my study window
i and my wife stood amazed then i realised that the crest of maybury
hill must be within range of the martians’ heat-ray now that the
college was cleared out of the way
at that i gripped my wife’s arm and without ceremony ran her out into
the road then i fetched out the servant telling her i would go
upstairs myself for the box she was clamouring for
“we can’t possibly stay here” i said; and as i spoke the firing
reopened for a moment upon the common
“but where are we to go” said my wife in terror
i thought perplexed then i remembered her cousins at leatherhead
“leatherhead!” i shouted above the sudden noise
she looked away from me downhill the people were coming out of their
houses astonished
“how are we to get to leatherhead” she said
down the hill i saw a bevy of hussars ride under the railway bridge;
three galloped through the open gates of the oriental college; two
others dismounted and began running from house to house the sun
shining through the smoke that drove up from the tops of the trees
seemed blood red and threw an unfamiliar lurid light upon everything
“stop here” said i; “you are safe here”; and i started off at once for
the spotted dog for i knew the landlord had a horse and dog cart i
ran for i perceived that in a moment everyone upon this side of the
hill would be moving i found him in his bar quite unaware of what was
going on behind his house a man stood with his back to me talking to
him
“i must have a pound” said the landlord “and i’ve no one to drive
it”
“i’ll give you two” said i over the stranger’s shoulder
“what for”
“and i’ll bring it back by midnight” i said
“lord!” said the landlord; “what’s the hurry i’m selling my bit of a
pig two pounds and you bring it back what’s going on now”
i explained hastily that i had to leave my home and so secured the dog
cart at the time it did not seem to me nearly so urgent that the
landlord should leave his i took care to have the cart there and then
drove it off down the road and leaving it in charge of my wife and
servant rushed into my house and packed a few valuables such plate as
we had and so forth the beech trees below the house were burning
while i did this and the palings up the road glowed red while i was
occupied in this way one of the dismounted hussars came running up he
was going from house to house warning people to leave he was going on
as i came out of my front door lugging my treasures done up in a
tablecloth i shouted after him:
“what news”
he turned stared bawled something about “crawling out in a thing like
a dish cover” and ran on to the gate of the house at the crest a
sudden whirl of black smoke driving across the road hid him for a
moment i ran to my neighbour’s door and rapped to satisfy myself of
what i already knew that his wife had gone to london with him and had
locked up their house i went in again according to my promise to get
my servant’s box lugged it out clapped it beside her on the tail of
the dog cart and then caught the reins and jumped up into the driver’s
seat beside my wife in another moment we were clear of the smoke and
noise and spanking down the opposite slope of maybury hill towards old
woking
in front was a quiet sunny landscape a wheat field ahead on either
side of the road and the maybury inn with its swinging sign i saw the
doctor’s cart ahead of me at the bottom of the hill i turned my head
to look at the hillside i was leaving thick streamers of black smoke
shot with threads of red fire were driving up into the still air and
throwing dark shadows upon the green treetops eastward the smoke
already extended far away to the east and west—to the byfleet pine
woods eastward and to woking on the west the road was dotted with
people running towards us and very faint now but very distinct
through the hot quiet air one heard the whirr of a machine-gun that
was presently stilled and an intermittent cracking of rifles
apparently the martians were setting fire to everything within range of
their heat-ray
i am not an expert driver and i had immediately to turn my attention
to the horse when i looked back again the second hill had hidden the
black smoke i slashed the horse with the whip and gave him a loose
rein until woking and send lay between us and that quivering tumult i
overtook and passed the doctor between woking and send
x
in the storm
leatherhead is about twelve miles from maybury hill the scent of hay
was in the air through the lush meadows beyond pyrford and the hedges
on either side were sweet and gay with multitudes of dog-roses the
heavy firing that had broken out while we were driving down maybury
hill ceased as abruptly as it began leaving the evening very peaceful
and still we got to leatherhead without misadventure about nine
o’clock and the horse had an hour’s rest while i took supper with my
cousins and commended my wife to their care
my wife was curiously silent throughout the drive and seemed oppressed
with forebodings of evil i talked to her reassuringly pointing out
that the martians were tied to the pit by sheer heaviness and at the
utmost could but crawl a little out of it; but she answered only in
monosyllables had it not been for my promise to the innkeeper she
would i think have urged me to stay in leatherhead that night would
that i had! her face i remember was very white as we parted
for my own part i had been feverishly excited all day something very
like the war fever that occasionally runs through a civilised community
had got into my blood and in my heart i was not so very sorry that i
had to return to maybury that night i was even afraid that that last
fusillade i had heard might mean the extermination of our invaders from
mars i can best express my state of mind by saying that i wanted to be
in at the death
it was nearly eleven when i started to return the night was
unexpectedly dark; to me walking out of the lighted passage of my
cousins’ house it seemed indeed black and it was as hot and close as
the day overhead the clouds were driving fast albeit not a breath
stirred the shrubs about us my cousins’ man lit both lamps happily i
knew the road intimately my wife stood in the light of the doorway
and watched me until i jumped up into the dog cart then abruptly she
turned and went in leaving my cousins side by side wishing me good
hap
i was a little depressed at first with the contagion of my wife’s
fears but very soon my thoughts reverted to the martians at that time
i was absolutely in the dark as to the course of the evening’s
fighting i did not know even the circumstances that had precipitated
the conflict as i came through ockham (for that was the way i
returned and not through send and old woking) i saw along the western
horizon a blood-red glow which as i drew nearer crept slowly up the
sky the driving clouds of the gathering thunderstorm mingled there
with masses of black and red smoke
ripley street was deserted and except for a lighted window or so the
village showed not a sign of life; but i narrowly escaped an accident
at the corner of the road to pyrford where a knot of people stood with
their backs to me they said nothing to me as i passed i do not know
what they knew of the things happening beyond the hill nor do i know
if the silent houses i passed on my way were sleeping securely or
deserted and empty or harassed and watching against the terror of the
night
from ripley until i came through pyrford i was in the valley of the
wey and the red glare was hidden from me as i ascended the little
hill beyond pyrford church the glare came into view again and the
trees about me shivered with the first intimation of the storm that was
upon me then i heard midnight pealing out from pyrford church behind
me and then came the silhouette of maybury hill with its tree-tops
and roofs black and sharp against the red
even as i beheld this a lurid green glare lit the road about me and
showed the distant woods towards addlestone i felt a tug at the reins
i saw that the driving clouds had been pierced as it were by a thread
of green fire suddenly lighting their confusion and falling into the
field to my left it was the third falling star!
close on its apparition and blindingly violet by contrast danced out
the first lightning of the gathering storm and the thunder burst like
a rocket overhead the horse took the bit between his teeth and bolted
a moderate incline runs towards the foot of maybury hill and down this
we clattered once the lightning had begun it went on in as rapid a
succession of flashes as i have ever seen the thunderclaps treading
one on the heels of another and with a strange crackling accompaniment
sounded more like the working of a gigantic electric machine than the
usual detonating reverberations the flickering light was blinding and
confusing and a thin hail smote gustily at my face as i drove down the
slope
at first i regarded little but the road before me and then abruptly my
attention was arrested by something that was moving rapidly down the
opposite slope of maybury hill at first i took it for the wet roof of
a house but one flash following another showed it to be in swift
rolling movement it was an elusive vision—a moment of bewildering
darkness and then in a flash like daylight the red masses of the
orphanage near the crest of the hill the green tops of the pine trees
and this problematical object came out clear and sharp and bright
and this thing i saw! how can i describe it a monstrous tripod higher
than many houses striding over the young pine trees and smashing them
aside in its career; a walking engine of glittering metal striding now
across the heather; articulate ropes of steel dangling from it and the
clattering tumult of its passage mingling with the riot of the thunder
a flash and it came out vividly heeling over one way with two feet in
the air to vanish and reappear almost instantly as it seemed with the
next flash a hundred yards nearer can you imagine a milking stool
tilted and bowled violently along the ground that was the impression
those instant flashes gave but instead of a milking stool imagine it a
great body of machinery on a tripod stand
then suddenly the trees in the pine wood ahead of me were parted as
brittle reeds are parted by a man thrusting through them; they were
snapped off and driven headlong and a second huge tripod appeared
rushing as it seemed headlong towards me and i was galloping hard to
meet it! at the sight of the second monster my nerve went altogether
not stopping to look again i wrenched the horse’s head hard round to
the right and in another moment the dog cart had heeled over upon the
horse; the shafts smashed noisily and i was flung sideways and fell
heavily into a shallow pool of water
i crawled out almost immediately and crouched my feet still in the
water under a clump of furze the horse lay motionless (his neck was
broken poor brute!) and by the lightning flashes i saw the black bulk
of the overturned dog cart and the silhouette of the wheel still
spinning slowly in another moment the colossal mechanism went striding
by me and passed uphill towards pyrford
seen nearer the thing was incredibly strange for it was no mere
insensate machine driving on its way machine it was with a ringing
metallic pace and long flexible glittering tentacles (one of which
gripped a young pine tree) swinging and rattling about its strange
body it picked its road as it went striding along and the brazen hood
that surmounted it moved to and fro with the inevitable suggestion of a
head looking about behind the main body was a huge mass of white metal
like a gigantic fisherman’s basket and puffs of green smoke squirted
out from the joints of the limbs as the monster swept by me and in an
instant it was gone
so much i saw then all vaguely for the flickering of the lightning in
blinding highlights and dense black shadows
as it passed it set up an exultant deafening howl that drowned the
thunder—“aloo! aloo!”—and in another minute it was with its companion
half a mile away stooping over something in the field i have no doubt
this thing in the field was the third of the ten cylinders they had
fired at us from mars
for some minutes i lay there in the rain and darkness watching by the
intermittent light these monstrous beings of metal moving about in the
distance over the hedge tops a thin hail was now beginning and as it
came and went their figures grew misty and then flashed into clearness
again now and then came a gap in the lightning and the night
swallowed them up
i was soaked with hail above and puddle water below it was some time
before my blank astonishment would let me struggle up the bank to a
drier position or think at all of my imminent peril
not far from me was a little one-roomed squatter’s hut of wood
surrounded by a patch of potato garden i struggled to my feet at last
and crouching and making use of every chance of cover i made a run
for this i hammered at the door but i could not make the people hear
(if there were any people inside) and after a time i desisted and
availing myself of a ditch for the greater part of the way succeeded
in crawling unobserved by these monstrous machines into the pine
woods towards maybury
under cover of this i pushed on wet and shivering now towards my own
house i walked among the trees trying to find the footpath it was
very dark indeed in the wood for the lightning was now becoming
infrequent and the hail which was pouring down in a torrent fell in
columns through the gaps in the heavy foliage
if i had fully realised the meaning of all the things i had seen i
should have immediately worked my way round through byfleet to street
cobham and so gone back to rejoin my wife at leatherhead but that
night the strangeness of things about me and my physical wretchedness
prevented me for i was bruised weary wet to the skin deafened and
blinded by the storm
i had a vague idea of going on to my own house and that was as much
motive as i had i staggered through the trees fell into a ditch and
bruised my knees against a plank and finally splashed out into the
lane that ran down from the college arms i say splashed for the storm
water was sweeping the sand down the hill in a muddy torrent there in
the darkness a man blundered into me and sent me reeling back
he gave a cry of terror sprang sideways and rushed on before i could
gather my wits sufficiently to speak to him so heavy was the stress of
the storm just at this place that i had the hardest task to win my way
up the hill i went close up to the fence on the left and worked my way
along its palings
near the top i stumbled upon something soft and by a flash of
lightning saw between my feet a heap of black broadcloth and a pair of
boots before i could distinguish clearly how the man lay the flicker
of light had passed i stood over him waiting for the next flash when
it came i saw that he was a sturdy man cheaply but not shabbily
dressed; his head was bent under his body and he lay crumpled up close
to the fence as though he had been flung violently against it
overcoming the repugnance natural to one who had never before touched a
dead body i stooped and turned him over to feel for his heart he was
quite dead apparently his neck had been broken the lightning flashed
for a third time and his face leaped upon me i sprang to my feet it
was the landlord of the spotted dog whose conveyance i had taken
i stepped over him gingerly and pushed on up the hill i made my way by
the police station and the college arms towards my own house nothing
was burning on the hillside though from the common there still came a
red glare and a rolling tumult of ruddy smoke beating up against the
drenching hail so far as i could see by the flashes the houses about
me were mostly uninjured by the college arms a dark heap lay in the
road
down the road towards maybury bridge there were voices and the sound of
feet but i had not the courage to shout or to go to them i let myself
in with my latchkey closed locked and bolted the door staggered to
the foot of the staircase and sat down my imagination was full of
those striding metallic monsters and of the dead body smashed against
the fence
i crouched at the foot of the staircase with my back to the wall
shivering violently
xi
at the window
i have already said that my storms of emotion have a trick of
exhausting themselves after a time i discovered that i was cold and
wet and with little pools of water about me on the stair carpet i got
up almost mechanically went into the dining room and drank some
whisky and then i was moved to change my clothes
after i had done that i went upstairs to my study but why i did so i
do not know the window of my study looks over the trees and the
railway towards horsell common in the hurry of our departure this
window had been left open the passage was dark and by contrast with
the picture the window frame enclosed the side of the room seemed
impenetrably dark i stopped short in the doorway
the thunderstorm had passed the towers of the oriental college and the
pine trees about it had gone and very far away lit by a vivid red
glare the common about the sand-pits was visible across the light
huge black shapes grotesque and strange moved busily to and fro
it seemed indeed as if the whole country in that direction was on
fire—a broad hillside set with minute tongues of flame swaying and
writhing with the gusts of the dying storm and throwing a red
reflection upon the cloud scud above every now and then a haze of
smoke from some nearer conflagration drove across the window and hid
the martian shapes i could not see what they were doing nor the clear
form of them nor recognise the black objects they were busied upon
neither could i see the nearer fire though the reflections of it
danced on the wall and ceiling of the study a sharp resinous tang of
burning was in the air
i closed the door noiselessly and crept towards the window as i did
so the view opened out until on the one hand it reached to the
houses about woking station and on the other to the charred and
blackened pine woods of byfleet there was a light down below the hill
on the railway near the arch and several of the houses along the
maybury road and the streets near the station were glowing ruins the
light upon the railway puzzled me at first; there were a black heap and
a vivid glare and to the right of that a row of yellow oblongs then i
perceived this was a wrecked train the fore part smashed and on fire
the hinder carriages still upon the rails
between these three main centres of light—the houses the train and
the burning county towards chobham—stretched irregular patches of dark
country broken here and there by intervals of dimly glowing and
smoking ground it was the strangest spectacle that black expanse set
with fire it reminded me more than anything else of the potteries at
night at first i could distinguish no people at all though i peered
intently for them later i saw against the light of woking station a
number of black figures hurrying one after the other across the line
and this was the little world in which i had been living securely for
years this fiery chaos! what had happened in the last seven hours i
still did not know; nor did i know though i was beginning to guess
the relation between these mechanical colossi and the sluggish lumps i
had seen disgorged from the cylinder with a queer feeling of
impersonal interest i turned my desk chair to the window sat down and
stared at the blackened country and particularly at the three gigantic
black things that were going to and fro in the glare about the
sand-pits
they seemed amazingly busy i began to ask myself what they could be
were they intelligent mechanisms such a thing i felt was impossible
or did a martian sit within each ruling directing using much as a
man’s brain sits and rules in his body i began to compare the things
to human machines to ask myself for the first time in my life how an
ironclad or a steam engine would seem to an intelligent lower animal
the storm had left the sky clear and over the smoke of the burning
land the little fading pinpoint of mars was dropping into the west
when a soldier came into my garden i heard a slight scraping at the
fence and rousing myself from the lethargy that had fallen upon me i
looked down and saw him dimly clambering over the palings at the
sight of another human being my torpor passed and i leaned out of the
window eagerly
“hist!” said i in a whisper
he stopped astride of the fence in doubt then he came over and across
the lawn to the corner of the house he bent down and stepped softly
“who’s there” he said also whispering standing under the window and
peering up
“where are you going” i asked
“god knows”
“are you trying to hide”
“that’s it”
“come into the house” i said
i went down unfastened the door and let him in and locked the door
again i could not see his face he was hatless and his coat was
unbuttoned
“my god!” he said as i drew him in
“what has happened” i asked
“what hasn’t” in the obscurity i could see he made a gesture of
despair “they wiped us out—simply wiped us out” he repeated again and
again
he followed me almost mechanically into the dining room
“take some whisky” i said pouring out a stiff dose
he drank it then abruptly he sat down before the table put his head
on his arms and began to sob and weep like a little boy in a perfect
passion of emotion while i with a curious forgetfulness of my own
recent despair stood beside him wondering
it was a long time before he could steady his nerves to answer my
questions and then he answered perplexingly and brokenly he was a
driver in the artillery and had only come into action about seven at
that time firing was going on across the common and it was said the
first party of martians were crawling slowly towards their second
cylinder under cover of a metal shield
later this shield staggered up on tripod legs and became the first of
the fighting-machines i had seen the gun he drove had been unlimbered
near horsell in order to command the sand-pits and its arrival it was
that had precipitated the action as the limber gunners went to the
rear his horse trod in a rabbit hole and came down throwing him into
a depression of the ground at the same moment the gun exploded behind
him the ammunition blew up there was fire all about him and he found
himself lying under a heap of charred dead men and dead horses
“i lay still” he said “scared out of my wits with the fore quarter
of a horse atop of me we’d been wiped out and the smell—good god!
like burnt meat! i was hurt across the back by the fall of the horse
and there i had to lie until i felt better just like parade it had
been a minute before—then stumble bang swish!”
“wiped out!” he said
he had hid under the dead horse for a long time peeping out furtively
across the common the cardigan men had tried a rush in skirmishing
order at the pit simply to be swept out of existence then the
monster had risen to its feet and had begun to walk leisurely to and
fro across the common among the few fugitives with its headlike hood
turning about exactly like the head of a cowled human being a kind of
arm carried a complicated metallic case about which green flashes
scintillated and out of the funnel of this there smoked the heat-ray
in a few minutes there was so far as the soldier could see not a
living thing left upon the common and every bush and tree upon it that
was not already a blackened skeleton was burning the hussars had been
on the road beyond the curvature of the ground and he saw nothing of
them he heard the maxims rattle for a time and then become still the
giant saved woking station and its cluster of houses until the last;
then in a moment the heat-ray was brought to bear and the town became
a heap of fiery ruins then the thing shut off the heat-ray and
turning its back upon the artilleryman began to waddle away towards
the smouldering pine woods that sheltered the second cylinder as it
did so a second glittering titan built itself up out of the pit
the second monster followed the first and at that the artilleryman
began to crawl very cautiously across the hot heather ash towards
horsell he managed to get alive into the ditch by the side of the
road and so escaped to woking there his story became ejaculatory the
place was impassable it seems there were a few people alive there
frantic for the most part and many burned and scalded he was turned
aside by the fire and hid among some almost scorching heaps of broken
wall as one of the martian giants returned he saw this one pursue a
man catch him up in one of its steely tentacles and knock his head
against the trunk of a pine tree at last after nightfall the
artilleryman made a rush for it and got over the railway embankment
since then he had been skulking along towards maybury in the hope of
getting out of danger londonward people were hiding in trenches and
cellars and many of the survivors had made off towards woking village
and send he had been consumed with thirst until he found one of the
water mains near the railway arch smashed and the water bubbling out
like a spring upon the road
that was the story i got from him bit by bit he grew calmer telling
me and trying to make me see the things he had seen he had eaten no
food since midday he told me early in his narrative and i found some
mutton and bread in the pantry and brought it into the room we lit no
lamp for fear of attracting the martians and ever and again our hands
would touch upon bread or meat as he talked things about us came
darkly out of the darkness and the trampled bushes and broken rose
trees outside the window grew distinct it would seem that a number of
men or animals had rushed across the lawn i began to see his face
blackened and haggard as no doubt mine was also
when we had finished eating we went softly upstairs to my study and i
looked again out of the open window in one night the valley had become
a valley of ashes the fires had dwindled now where flames had been
there were now streamers of smoke; but the countless ruins of shattered
and gutted houses and blasted and blackened trees that the night had
hidden stood out now gaunt and terrible in the pitiless light of dawn
yet here and there some object had had the luck to escape—a white
railway signal here the end of a greenhouse there white and fresh
amid the wreckage never before in the history of warfare had
destruction been so indiscriminate and so universal and shining with
the growing light of the east three of the metallic giants stood about
the pit their cowls rotating as though they were surveying the
desolation they had made
it seemed to me that the pit had been enlarged and ever and again
puffs of vivid green vapour streamed up and out of it towards the
brightening dawn—streamed up whirled broke and vanished
beyond were the pillars of fire about chobham they became pillars of
bloodshot smoke at the first touch of day
xii
what i saw of the destruction of weybridge and shepperton
as the dawn grew brighter we withdrew from the window from which we had
watched the martians and went very quietly downstairs
the artilleryman agreed with me that the house was no place to stay in
he proposed he said to make his way londonward and thence rejoin his
battery—no  of the horse artillery my plan was to return at once
to leatherhead; and so greatly had the strength of the martians
impressed me that i had determined to take my wife to newhaven and go
with her out of the country forthwith for i already perceived clearly
that the country about london must inevitably be the scene of a
disastrous struggle before such creatures as these could be destroyed
between us and leatherhead however lay the third cylinder with its
guarding giants had i been alone i think i should have taken my
chance and struck across country but the artilleryman dissuaded me:
“it’s no kindness to the right sort of wife” he said “to make her a
widow”; and in the end i agreed to go with him under cover of the
woods northward as far as street cobham before i parted with him
thence i would make a big detour by epsom to reach leatherhead
i should have started at once but my companion had been in active
service and he knew better than that he made me ransack the house for
a flask which he filled with whisky; and we lined every available
pocket with packets of biscuits and slices of meat then we crept out
of the house and ran as quickly as we could down the ill-made road by
which i had come overnight the houses seemed deserted in the road lay
a group of three charred bodies close together struck dead by the
heat-ray; and here and there were things that people had dropped—a
clock a slipper a silver spoon and the like poor valuables at the
corner turning up towards the post office a little cart filled with
boxes and furniture and horseless heeled over on a broken wheel a
cash box had been hastily smashed open and thrown under the debris
except the lodge at the orphanage which was still on fire none of the
houses had suffered very greatly here the heat-ray had shaved the
chimney tops and passed yet save ourselves there did not seem to be
a living soul on maybury hill the majority of the inhabitants had
escaped i suppose by way of the old woking road—the road i had taken
when i drove to leatherhead—or they had hidden
we went down the lane by the body of the man in black sodden now from
the overnight hail and broke into the woods at the foot of the hill
we pushed through these towards the railway without meeting a soul the
woods across the line were but the scarred and blackened ruins of
woods; for the most part the trees had fallen but a certain proportion
still stood dismal grey stems with dark brown foliage instead of
green
on our side the fire had done no more than scorch the nearer trees; it
had failed to secure its footing in one place the woodmen had been at
work on saturday; trees felled and freshly trimmed lay in a clearing
with heaps of sawdust by the sawing-machine and its engine hard by was
a temporary hut deserted there was not a breath of wind this morning
and everything was strangely still even the birds were hushed and as
we hurried along i and the artilleryman talked in whispers and looked
now and again over our shoulders once or twice we stopped to listen
after a time we drew near the road and as we did so we heard the
clatter of hoofs and saw through the tree stems three cavalry soldiers
riding slowly towards woking we hailed them and they halted while we
hurried towards them it was a lieutenant and a couple of privates of
the th hussars with a stand like a theodolite which the artilleryman
told me was a heliograph
“you are the first men i’ve seen coming this way this morning” said
the lieutenant “what’s brewing”
his voice and face were eager the men behind him stared curiously the
artilleryman jumped down the bank into the road and saluted
“gun destroyed last night sir have been hiding trying to rejoin
battery sir you’ll come in sight of the martians i expect about
half a mile along this road”
“what the dickens are they like” asked the lieutenant
“giants in armour sir hundred feet high three legs and a body like
’luminium with a mighty great head in a hood sir”
“get out!” said the lieutenant “what confounded nonsense!”
“you’ll see sir they carry a kind of box sir that shoots fire and
strikes you dead”
“what d’ye mean—a gun”
“no sir” and the artilleryman began a vivid account of the heat-ray
halfway through the lieutenant interrupted him and looked up at me i
was still standing on the bank by the side of the road
“it’s perfectly true” i said
“well” said the lieutenant “i suppose it’s my business to see it too
look here”—to the artilleryman—“we’re detailed here clearing people out
of their houses you’d better go along and report yourself to
brigadier-general marvin and tell him all you know he’s at weybridge
know the way”
“i do” i said; and he turned his horse southward again
“half a mile you say” said he
“at most” i answered and pointed over the treetops southward he
thanked me and rode on and we saw them no more
farther along we came upon a group of three women and two children in
the road busy clearing out a labourer’s cottage they had got hold of
a little hand truck and were piling it up with unclean-looking bundles
and shabby furniture they were all too assiduously engaged to talk to
us as we passed
by byfleet station we emerged from the pine trees and found the
country calm and peaceful under the morning sunlight we were far
beyond the range of the heat-ray there and had it not been for the
silent desertion of some of the houses the stirring movement of
packing in others and the knot of soldiers standing on the bridge over
the railway and staring down the line towards woking the day would
have seemed very like any other sunday
several farm waggons and carts were moving creakily along the road to
addlestone and suddenly through the gate of a field we saw across a
stretch of flat meadow six twelve-pounders standing neatly at equal
distances pointing towards woking the gunners stood by the guns
waiting and the ammunition waggons were at a business-like distance
the men stood almost as if under inspection
“that’s good!” said i “they will get one fair shot at any rate”
the artilleryman hesitated at the gate
“i shall go on” he said
farther on towards weybridge just over the bridge there were a number
of men in white fatigue jackets throwing up a long rampart and more
guns behind
“it’s bows and arrows against the lightning anyhow” said the
artilleryman “they ’aven’t seen that fire-beam yet”
the officers who were not actively engaged stood and stared over the
treetops southwestward and the men digging would stop every now and
again to stare in the same direction
byfleet was in a tumult; people packing and a score of hussars some
of them dismounted some on horseback were hunting them about three
or four black government waggons with crosses in white circles and an
old omnibus among other vehicles were being loaded in the village
street there were scores of people most of them sufficiently
sabbatical to have assumed their best clothes the soldiers were having
the greatest difficulty in making them realise the gravity of their
position we saw one shrivelled old fellow with a huge box and a score
or more of flower pots containing orchids angrily expostulating with
the corporal who would leave them behind i stopped and gripped his
arm
“do you know what’s over there” i said pointing at the pine tops that
hid the martians
“eh” said he turning “i was explainin’ these is vallyble”
“death!” i shouted “death is coming! death!” and leaving him to digest
that if he could i hurried on after the artillery-man at the corner i
looked back the soldier had left him and he was still standing by his
box with the pots of orchids on the lid of it and staring vaguely
over the trees
no one in weybridge could tell us where the headquarters were
established; the whole place was in such confusion as i had never seen
in any town before carts carriages everywhere the most astonishing
miscellany of conveyances and horseflesh the respectable inhabitants
of the place men in golf and boating costumes wives prettily dressed
were packing river-side loafers energetically helping children
excited and for the most part highly delighted at this astonishing
variation of their sunday experiences in the midst of it all the
worthy vicar was very pluckily holding an early celebration and his
bell was jangling out above the excitement
i and the artilleryman seated on the step of the drinking fountain
made a very passable meal upon what we had brought with us patrols of
soldiers—here no longer hussars but grenadiers in white—were warning
people to move now or to take refuge in their cellars as soon as the
firing began we saw as we crossed the railway bridge that a growing
crowd of people had assembled in and about the railway station and the
swarming platform was piled with boxes and packages the ordinary
traffic had been stopped i believe in order to allow of the passage
of troops and guns to chertsey and i have heard since that a savage
struggle occurred for places in the special trains that were put on at
a later hour
we remained at weybridge until midday and at that hour we found
ourselves at the place near shepperton lock where the wey and thames
join part of the time we spent helping two old women to pack a little
cart the wey has a treble mouth and at this point boats are to be
hired and there was a ferry across the river on the shepperton side
was an inn with a lawn and beyond that the tower of shepperton
church—it has been replaced by a spire—rose above the trees
here we found an excited and noisy crowd of fugitives as yet the
flight had not grown to a panic but there were already far more people
than all the boats going to and fro could enable to cross people came
panting along under heavy burdens; one husband and wife were even
carrying a small outhouse door between them with some of their
household goods piled thereon one man told us he meant to try to get
away from shepperton station
there was a lot of shouting and one man was even jesting the idea
people seemed to have here was that the martians were simply formidable
human beings who might attack and sack the town to be certainly
destroyed in the end every now and then people would glance nervously
across the wey at the meadows towards chertsey but everything over
there was still
across the thames except just where the boats landed everything was
quiet in vivid contrast with the surrey side the people who landed
there from the boats went tramping off down the lane the big ferryboat
had just made a journey three or four soldiers stood on the lawn of
the inn staring and jesting at the fugitives without offering to
help the inn was closed as it was now within prohibited hours
“what’s that” cried a boatman and “shut up you fool!” said a man
near me to a yelping dog then the sound came again this time from the
direction of chertsey a muffled thud—the sound of a gun
the fighting was beginning almost immediately unseen batteries across
the river to our right unseen because of the trees took up the
chorus firing heavily one after the other a woman screamed everyone
stood arrested by the sudden stir of battle near us and yet invisible
to us nothing was to be seen save flat meadows cows feeding
unconcernedly for the most part and silvery pollard willows motionless
in the warm sunlight
“the sojers’ll stop ’em” said a woman beside me doubtfully a
haziness rose over the treetops
then suddenly we saw a rush of smoke far away up the river a puff of
smoke that jerked up into the air and hung; and forthwith the ground
heaved under foot and a heavy explosion shook the air smashing two or
three windows in the houses near and leaving us astonished
“here they are!” shouted a man in a blue jersey “yonder! d’yer see
them yonder!”
quickly one after the other one two three four of the armoured
martians appeared far away over the little trees across the flat
meadows that stretched towards chertsey and striding hurriedly towards
the river little cowled figures they seemed at first going with a
rolling motion and as fast as flying birds
then advancing obliquely towards us came a fifth their armoured
bodies glittered in the sun as they swept swiftly forward upon the
guns growing rapidly larger as they drew nearer one on the extreme
left the remotest that is flourished a huge case high in the air and
the ghostly terrible heat-ray i had already seen on friday night smote
towards chertsey and struck the town
at sight of these strange swift and terrible creatures the crowd near
the water’s edge seemed to me to be for a moment horror-struck there
was no screaming or shouting but a silence then a hoarse murmur and a
movement of feet—a splashing from the water a man too frightened to
drop the portmanteau he carried on his shoulder swung round and sent
me staggering with a blow from the corner of his burden a woman thrust
at me with her hand and rushed past me i turned with the rush of the
people but i was not too terrified for thought the terrible heat-ray
was in my mind to get under water! that was it!
“get under water!” i shouted unheeded
i faced about again and rushed towards the approaching martian rushed
right down the gravelly beach and headlong into the water others did
the same a boatload of people putting back came leaping out as i
rushed past the stones under my feet were muddy and slippery and the
river was so low that i ran perhaps twenty feet scarcely waist-deep
then as the martian towered overhead scarcely a couple of hundred
yards away i flung myself forward under the surface the splashes of
the people in the boats leaping into the river sounded like
thunderclaps in my ears people were landing hastily on both sides of
the river but the martian machine took no more notice for the moment
of the people running this way and that than a man would of the
confusion of ants in a nest against which his foot has kicked when
half suffocated i raised my head above water the martian’s hood
pointed at the batteries that were still firing across the river and
as it advanced it swung loose what must have been the generator of the
heat-ray
in another moment it was on the bank and in a stride wading halfway
across the knees of its foremost legs bent at the farther bank and in
another moment it had raised itself to its full height again close to
the village of shepperton forthwith the six guns which unknown to
anyone on the right bank had been hidden behind the outskirts of that
village fired simultaneously the sudden near concussion the last
close upon the first made my heart jump the monster was already
raising the case generating the heat-ray as the first shell burst six
yards above the hood
i gave a cry of astonishment i saw and thought nothing of the other
four martian monsters; my attention was riveted upon the nearer
incident simultaneously two other shells burst in the air near the
body as the hood twisted round in time to receive but not in time to
dodge the fourth shell
the shell burst clean in the face of the thing the hood bulged
flashed was whirled off in a dozen tattered fragments of red flesh and
glittering metal
“hit!” shouted i with something between a scream and a cheer
i heard answering shouts from the people in the water about me i could
have leaped out of the water with that momentary exultation
the decapitated colossus reeled like a drunken giant; but it did not
fall over it recovered its balance by a miracle and no longer
heeding its steps and with the camera that fired the heat-ray now
rigidly upheld it reeled swiftly upon shepperton the living
intelligence the martian within the hood was slain and splashed to
the four winds of heaven and the thing was now but a mere intricate
device of metal whirling to destruction it drove along in a straight
line incapable of guidance it struck the tower of shepperton church
smashing it down as the impact of a battering ram might have done
swerved aside blundered on and collapsed with tremendous force into
the river out of my sight
a violent explosion shook the air and a spout of water steam mud
and shattered metal shot far up into the sky as the camera of the
heat-ray hit the water the latter had immediately flashed into steam
in another moment a huge wave like a muddy tidal bore but almost
scaldingly hot came sweeping round the bend upstream i saw people
struggling shorewards and heard their screaming and shouting faintly
above the seething and roar of the martian’s collapse
for a moment i heeded nothing of the heat forgot the patent need of
self-preservation i splashed through the tumultuous water pushing
aside a man in black to do so until i could see round the bend half a
dozen deserted boats pitched aimlessly upon the confusion of the waves
the fallen martian came into sight downstream lying across the river
and for the most part submerged
thick clouds of steam were pouring off the wreckage and through the
tumultuously whirling wisps i could see intermittently and vaguely
the gigantic limbs churning the water and flinging a splash and spray
of mud and froth into the air the tentacles swayed and struck like
living arms and save for the helpless purposelessness of these
movements it was as if some wounded thing were struggling for its life
amid the waves enormous quantities of a ruddy-brown fluid were
spurting up in noisy jets out of the machine
my attention was diverted from this death flurry by a furious yelling
like that of the thing called a siren in our manufacturing towns a
man knee-deep near the towing path shouted inaudibly to me and
pointed looking back i saw the other martians advancing with gigantic
strides down the riverbank from the direction of chertsey the
shepperton guns spoke this time unavailingly
at that i ducked at once under water and holding my breath until
movement was an agony blundered painfully ahead under the surface as
long as i could the water was in a tumult about me and rapidly
growing hotter
when for a moment i raised my head to take breath and throw the hair
and water from my eyes the steam was rising in a whirling white fog
that at first hid the martians altogether the noise was deafening
then i saw them dimly colossal figures of grey magnified by the mist
they had passed by me and two were stooping over the frothing
tumultuous ruins of their comrade
the third and fourth stood beside him in the water one perhaps two
hundred yards from me the other towards laleham the generators of the
heat-rays waved high and the hissing beams smote down this way and
that
the air was full of sound a deafening and confusing conflict of
noises—the clangorous din of the martians the crash of falling houses
the thud of trees fences sheds flashing into flame and the crackling
and roaring of fire dense black smoke was leaping up to mingle with
the steam from the river and as the heat-ray went to and fro over
weybridge its impact was marked by flashes of incandescent white that
gave place at once to a smoky dance of lurid flames the nearer houses
still stood intact awaiting their fate shadowy faint and pallid in
the steam with the fire behind them going to and fro
for a moment perhaps i stood there breast-high in the almost boiling
water dumbfounded at my position hopeless of escape through the reek
i could see the people who had been with me in the river scrambling out
of the water through the reeds like little frogs hurrying through
grass from the advance of a man or running to and fro in utter dismay
on the towing path
then suddenly the white flashes of the heat-ray came leaping towards
me the houses caved in as they dissolved at its touch and darted out
flames; the trees changed to fire with a roar the ray flickered up and
down the towing path licking off the people who ran this way and that
and came down to the water’s edge not fifty yards from where i stood
it swept across the river to shepperton and the water in its track
rose in a boiling weal crested with steam i turned shoreward
in another moment the huge wave well-nigh at the boiling-point had
rushed upon me i screamed aloud and scalded half blinded agonised
i staggered through the leaping hissing water towards the shore had
my foot stumbled it would have been the end i fell helplessly in
full sight of the martians upon the broad bare gravelly spit that
runs down to mark the angle of the wey and thames i expected nothing
but death
i have a dim memory of the foot of a martian coming down within a score
of yards of my head driving straight into the loose gravel whirling
it this way and that and lifting again; of a long suspense and then of
the four carrying the debris of their comrade between them now clear
and then presently faint through a veil of smoke receding
interminably as it seemed to me across a vast space of river and
meadow and then very slowly i realised that by a miracle i had
escaped
xiii
how i fell in with the curate
after getting this sudden lesson in the power of terrestrial weapons
the martians retreated to their original position upon horsell common;
and in their haste and encumbered with the debris of their smashed
companion they no doubt overlooked many such a stray and negligible
victim as myself had they left their comrade and pushed on forthwith
there was nothing at that time between them and london but batteries of
twelve-pounder guns and they would certainly have reached the capital
in advance of the tidings of their approach; as sudden dreadful and
destructive their advent would have been as the earthquake that
destroyed lisbon a century ago
but they were in no hurry cylinder followed cylinder on its
interplanetary flight; every twenty-four hours brought them
reinforcement and meanwhile the military and naval authorities now
fully alive to the tremendous power of their antagonists worked with
furious energy every minute a fresh gun came into position until
before twilight every copse every row of suburban villas on the hilly
slopes about kingston and richmond masked an expectant black muzzle
and through the charred and desolated area—perhaps twenty square miles
altogether—that encircled the martian encampment on horsell common
through charred and ruined villages among the green trees through the
blackened and smoking arcades that had been but a day ago pine
spinneys crawled the devoted scouts with the heliographs that were
presently to warn the gunners of the martian approach but the martians
now understood our command of artillery and the danger of human
proximity and not a man ventured within a mile of either cylinder
save at the price of his life
it would seem that these giants spent the earlier part of the afternoon
in going to and fro transferring everything from the second and third
cylinders—the second in addlestone golf links and the third at
pyrford—to their original pit on horsell common over that above the
blackened heather and ruined buildings that stretched far and wide
stood one as sentinel while the rest abandoned their vast
fighting-machines and descended into the pit they were hard at work
there far into the night and the towering pillar of dense green smoke
that rose therefrom could be seen from the hills about merrow and
even it is said from banstead and epsom downs
and while the martians behind me were thus preparing for their next
sally and in front of me humanity gathered for the battle i made my
way with infinite pains and labour from the fire and smoke of burning
weybridge towards london
i saw an abandoned boat very small and remote drifting down-stream;
and throwing off the most of my sodden clothes i went after it gained
it and so escaped out of that destruction there were no oars in the
boat but i contrived to paddle as well as my parboiled hands would
allow down the river towards halliford and walton going very
tediously and continually looking behind me as you may well
understand i followed the river because i considered that the water
gave me my best chance of escape should these giants return
the hot water from the martian’s overthrow drifted downstream with me
so that for the best part of a mile i could see little of either bank
once however i made out a string of black figures hurrying across the
meadows from the direction of weybridge halliford it seemed was
deserted and several of the houses facing the river were on fire it
was strange to see the place quite tranquil quite desolate under the
hot blue sky with the smoke and little threads of flame going straight
up into the heat of the afternoon never before had i seen houses
burning without the accompaniment of an obstructive crowd a little
farther on the dry reeds up the bank were smoking and glowing and a
line of fire inland was marching steadily across a late field of hay
for a long time i drifted so painful and weary was i after the
violence i had been through and so intense the heat upon the water
then my fears got the better of me again and i resumed my paddling
the sun scorched my bare back at last as the bridge at walton was
coming into sight round the bend my fever and faintness overcame my
fears and i landed on the middlesex bank and lay down deadly sick
amid the long grass i suppose the time was then about four or five
o’clock i got up presently walked perhaps half a mile without meeting
a soul and then lay down again in the shadow of a hedge i seem to
remember talking wanderingly to myself during that last spurt i was
also very thirsty and bitterly regretful i had drunk no more water it
is a curious thing that i felt angry with my wife; i cannot account for
it but my impotent desire to reach leatherhead worried me excessively
i do not clearly remember the arrival of the curate so that probably i
dozed i became aware of him as a seated figure in soot-smudged shirt
sleeves and with his upturned clean-shaven face staring at a faint
flickering that danced over the sky the sky was what is called a
mackerel sky—rows and rows of faint down-plumes of cloud just tinted
with the midsummer sunset
i sat up and at the rustle of my motion he looked at me quickly
“have you any water” i asked abruptly
he shook his head
“you have been asking for water for the last hour” he said
for a moment we were silent taking stock of each other i dare say he
found me a strange enough figure naked save for my water-soaked
trousers and socks scalded and my face and shoulders blackened by the
smoke his face was a fair weakness his chin retreated and his hair
lay in crisp almost flaxen curls on his low forehead; his eyes were
rather large pale blue and blankly staring he spoke abruptly
looking vacantly away from me
“what does it mean” he said “what do these things mean”
i stared at him and made no answer
he extended a thin white hand and spoke in almost a complaining tone
“why are these things permitted what sins have we done the morning
service was over i was walking through the roads to clear my brain for
the afternoon and then—fire earthquake death! as if it were sodom
and gomorrah! all our work undone all the work—— what are these
martians”
“what are we” i answered clearing my throat
he gripped his knees and turned to look at me again for half a minute
perhaps he stared silently
“i was walking through the roads to clear my brain” he said “and
suddenly—fire earthquake death!”
he relapsed into silence with his chin now sunken almost to his knees
presently he began waving his hand
“all the work—all the sunday schools—what have we done—what has
weybridge done everything gone—everything destroyed the church! we
rebuilt it only three years ago gone! swept out of existence! why”
another pause and he broke out again like one demented
“the smoke of her burning goeth up for ever and ever!” he shouted
his eyes flamed and he pointed a lean finger in the direction of
weybridge
by this time i was beginning to take his measure the tremendous
tragedy in which he had been involved—it was evident he was a fugitive
from weybridge—had driven him to the very verge of his reason
“are we far from sunbury” i said in a matter-of-fact tone
“what are we to do” he asked “are these creatures everywhere has the
earth been given over to them”
“are we far from sunbury”
“only this morning i officiated at early celebration——”
“things have changed” i said quietly “you must keep your head there
is still hope”
“hope!”
“yes plentiful hope—for all this destruction!”
i began to explain my view of our position he listened at first but
as i went on the interest dawning in his eyes gave place to their
former stare and his regard wandered from me
“this must be the beginning of the end” he said interrupting me “the
end! the great and terrible day of the lord! when men shall call upon
the mountains and the rocks to fall upon them and hide them—hide them
from the face of him that sitteth upon the throne!”
i began to understand the position i ceased my laboured reasoning
struggled to my feet and standing over him laid my hand on his
shoulder
“be a man!” said i “you are scared out of your wits! what good is
religion if it collapses under calamity think of what earthquakes and
floods wars and volcanoes have done before to men! did you think god
had exempted weybridge he is not an insurance agent”
for a time he sat in blank silence
“but how can we escape” he asked suddenly “they are invulnerable
they are pitiless”
“neither the one nor perhaps the other” i answered “and the
mightier they are the more sane and wary should we be one of them was
killed yonder not three hours ago”
“killed!” he said staring about him “how can god’s ministers be
killed”
“i saw it happen” i proceeded to tell him “we have chanced to come in
for the thick of it” said i “and that is all”
“what is that flicker in the sky” he asked abruptly
i told him it was the heliograph signalling—that it was the sign of
human help and effort in the sky
“we are in the midst of it” i said “quiet as it is that flicker in
the sky tells of the gathering storm yonder i take it are the
martians and londonward where those hills rise about richmond and
kingston and the trees give cover earthworks are being thrown up and
guns are being placed presently the martians will be coming this way
again”
and even as i spoke he sprang to his feet and stopped me by a gesture
“listen!” he said
from beyond the low hills across the water came the dull resonance of
distant guns and a remote weird crying then everything was still a
cockchafer came droning over the hedge and past us high in the west
the crescent moon hung faint and pale above the smoke of weybridge and
shepperton and the hot still splendour of the sunset
“we had better follow this path” i said “northward”
xiv
in london
my younger brother was in london when the martians fell at woking he
was a medical student working for an imminent examination and he heard
nothing of the arrival until saturday morning the morning papers on
saturday contained in addition to lengthy special articles on the
planet mars on life in the planets and so forth a brief and vaguely
worded telegram all the more striking for its brevity
the martians alarmed by the approach of a crowd had killed a number
of people with a quick-firing gun so the story ran the telegram
concluded with the words: “formidable as they seem to be the martians
have not moved from the pit into which they have fallen and indeed
seem incapable of doing so probably this is due to the relative
strength of the earth’s gravitational energy” on that last text their
leader-writer expanded very comfortingly
of course all the students in the crammer’s biology class to which my
brother went that day were intensely interested but there were no
signs of any unusual excitement in the streets the afternoon papers
puffed scraps of news under big headlines they had nothing to tell
beyond the movements of troops about the common and the burning of the
pine woods between woking and weybridge until eight then the _st
james’s gazette_ in an extra-special edition announced the bare fact
of the interruption of telegraphic communication this was thought to
be due to the falling of burning pine trees across the line nothing
more of the fighting was known that night the night of my drive to
leatherhead and back
my brother felt no anxiety about us as he knew from the description in
the papers that the cylinder was a good two miles from my house he
made up his mind to run down that night to me in order as he says to
see the things before they were killed he dispatched a telegram which
never reached me about four o’clock and spent the evening at a music
hall
in london also on saturday night there was a thunderstorm and my
brother reached waterloo in a cab on the platform from which the
midnight train usually starts he learned after some waiting that an
accident prevented trains from reaching woking that night the nature
of the accident he could not ascertain; indeed the railway authorities
did not clearly know at that time there was very little excitement in
the station as the officials failing to realise that anything further
than a breakdown between byfleet and woking junction had occurred were
running the theatre trains which usually passed through woking round by
virginia water or guildford they were busy making the necessary
arrangements to alter the route of the southampton and portsmouth
sunday league excursions a nocturnal newspaper reporter mistaking my
brother for the traffic manager to whom he bears a slight resemblance
waylaid and tried to interview him few people excepting the railway
officials connected the breakdown with the martians
i have read in another account of these events that on sunday morning
“all london was electrified by the news from woking” as a matter of
fact there was nothing to justify that very extravagant phrase plenty
of londoners did not hear of the martians until the panic of monday
morning those who did took some time to realise all that the hastily
worded telegrams in the sunday papers conveyed the majority of people
in london do not read sunday papers
the habit of personal security moreover is so deeply fixed in the
londoner’s mind and startling intelligence so much a matter of course
in the papers that they could read without any personal tremors:
“about seven o’clock last night the martians came out of the cylinder
and moving about under an armour of metallic shields have completely
wrecked woking station with the adjacent houses and massacred an
entire battalion of the cardigan regiment no details are known maxims
have been absolutely useless against their armour; the field guns have
been disabled by them flying hussars have been galloping into
chertsey the martians appear to be moving slowly towards chertsey or
windsor great anxiety prevails in west surrey and earthworks are
being thrown up to check the advance londonward” that was how the
_sunday sun_ put it and a clever and remarkably prompt “handbook”
article in the _referee_ compared the affair to a menagerie suddenly
let loose in a village
no one in london knew positively of the nature of the armoured
martians and there was still a fixed idea that these monsters must be
sluggish: “crawling” “creeping painfully”—such expressions occurred in
almost all the earlier reports none of the telegrams could have been
written by an eyewitness of their advance the sunday papers printed
separate editions as further news came to hand some even in default of
it but there was practically nothing more to tell people until late in
the afternoon when the authorities gave the press agencies the news in
their possession it was stated that the people of walton and
weybridge and all the district were pouring along the roads
londonward and that was all
my brother went to church at the foundling hospital in the morning
still in ignorance of what had happened on the previous night there he
heard allusions made to the invasion and a special prayer for peace
coming out he bought a _referee_ he became alarmed at the news in
this and went again to waterloo station to find out if communication
were restored the omnibuses carriages cyclists and innumerable
people walking in their best clothes seemed scarcely affected by the
strange intelligence that the newsvendors were disseminating people
were interested or if alarmed alarmed only on account of the local
residents at the station he heard for the first time that the windsor
and chertsey lines were now interrupted the porters told him that
several remarkable telegrams had been received in the morning from
byfleet and chertsey stations but that these had abruptly ceased my
brother could get very little precise detail out of them
“there’s fighting going on about weybridge” was the extent of their
information
the train service was now very much disorganised quite a number of
people who had been expecting friends from places on the south-western
network were standing about the station one grey-headed old gentleman
came and abused the south-western company bitterly to my brother “it
wants showing up” he said
one or two trains came in from richmond putney and kingston
containing people who had gone out for a day’s boating and found the
locks closed and a feeling of panic in the air a man in a blue and
white blazer addressed my brother full of strange tidings
“there’s hosts of people driving into kingston in traps and carts and
things with boxes of valuables and all that” he said “they come from
molesey and weybridge and walton and they say there’s been guns heard
at chertsey heavy firing and that mounted soldiers have told them to
get off at once because the martians are coming we heard guns firing
at hampton court station but we thought it was thunder what the
dickens does it all mean the martians can’t get out of their pit can
they”
my brother could not tell him
afterwards he found that the vague feeling of alarm had spread to the
clients of the underground railway and that the sunday excursionists
began to return from all over the south-western “lung”—barnes
wimbledon richmond park kew and so forth—at unnaturally early hours;
but not a soul had anything more than vague hearsay to tell of
everyone connected with the terminus seemed ill-tempered
about five o’clock the gathering crowd in the station was immensely
excited by the opening of the line of communication which is almost
invariably closed between the south-eastern and the south-western
stations and the passage of carriage trucks bearing huge guns and
carriages crammed with soldiers these were the guns that were brought
up from woolwich and chatham to cover kingston there was an exchange
of pleasantries: “you’ll get eaten!” “we’re the beast-tamers!” and so
forth a little while after that a squad of police came into the
station and began to clear the public off the platforms and my brother
went out into the street again
the church bells were ringing for evensong and a squad of salvation
army lassies came singing down waterloo road on the bridge a number of
loafers were watching a curious brown scum that came drifting down the
stream in patches the sun was just setting and the clock tower and
the houses of parliament rose against one of the most peaceful skies it
is possible to imagine a sky of gold barred with long transverse
stripes of reddish-purple cloud there was talk of a floating body one
of the men there a reservist he said he was told my brother he had
seen the heliograph flickering in the west
in wellington street my brother met a couple of sturdy roughs who had
just been rushed out of fleet street with still-wet newspapers and
staring placards “dreadful catastrophe!” they bawled one to the other
down wellington street “fighting at weybridge! full description!
repulse of the martians! london in danger!” he had to give threepence
for a copy of that paper
then it was and then only that he realised something of the full
power and terror of these monsters he learned that they were not
merely a handful of small sluggish creatures but that they were minds
swaying vast mechanical bodies; and that they could move swiftly and
smite with such power that even the mightiest guns could not stand
against them
they were described as “vast spiderlike machines nearly a hundred feet
high capable of the speed of an express train and able to shoot out a
beam of intense heat” masked batteries chiefly of field guns had
been planted in the country about horsell common and especially
between the woking district and london five of the machines had been
seen moving towards the thames and one by a happy chance had been
destroyed in the other cases the shells had missed and the batteries
had been at once annihilated by the heat-rays heavy losses of soldiers
were mentioned but the tone of the dispatch was optimistic
the martians had been repulsed; they were not invulnerable they had
retreated to their triangle of cylinders again in the circle about
woking signallers with heliographs were pushing forward upon them from
all sides guns were in rapid transit from windsor portsmouth
aldershot woolwich—even from the north; among others long wire-guns
of ninety-five tons from woolwich altogether one hundred and sixteen
were in position or being hastily placed chiefly covering london
never before in england had there been such a vast or rapid
concentration of military material
any further cylinders that fell it was hoped could be destroyed at
once by high explosives which were being rapidly manufactured and
distributed no doubt ran the report the situation was of the
strangest and gravest description but the public was exhorted to avoid
and discourage panic no doubt the martians were strange and terrible
in the extreme but at the outside there could not be more than twenty
of them against our millions
the authorities had reason to suppose from the size of the cylinders
that at the outside there could not be more than five in each
cylinder—fifteen altogether and one at least was disposed of—perhaps
more the public would be fairly warned of the approach of danger and
elaborate measures were being taken for the protection of the people in
the threatened southwestern suburbs and so with reiterated assurances
of the safety of london and the ability of the authorities to cope with
the difficulty this quasi-proclamation closed
this was printed in enormous type on paper so fresh that it was still
wet and there had been no time to add a word of comment it was
curious my brother said to see how ruthlessly the usual contents of
the paper had been hacked and taken out to give this place
all down wellington street people could be seen fluttering out the pink
sheets and reading and the strand was suddenly noisy with the voices
of an army of hawkers following these pioneers men came scrambling off
buses to secure copies certainly this news excited people intensely
whatever their previous apathy the shutters of a map shop in the
strand were being taken down my brother said and a man in his sunday
raiment lemon-yellow gloves even was visible inside the window
hastily fastening maps of surrey to the glass
going on along the strand to trafalgar square the paper in his hand
my brother saw some of the fugitives from west surrey there was a man
with his wife and two boys and some articles of furniture in a cart
such as greengrocers use he was driving from the direction of
westminster bridge; and close behind him came a hay waggon with five or
six respectable-looking people in it and some boxes and bundles the
faces of these people were haggard and their entire appearance
contrasted conspicuously with the sabbath-best appearance of the people
on the omnibuses people in fashionable clothing peeped at them out of
cabs they stopped at the square as if undecided which way to take and
finally turned eastward along the strand some way behind these came a
man in workday clothes riding one of those old-fashioned tricycles
with a small front wheel he was dirty and white in the face
my brother turned down towards victoria and met a number of such
people he had a vague idea that he might see something of me he
noticed an unusual number of police regulating the traffic some of the
refugees were exchanging news with the people on the omnibuses one was
professing to have seen the martians “boilers on stilts i tell you
striding along like men” most of them were excited and animated by
their strange experience
beyond victoria the public-houses were doing a lively trade with these
arrivals at all the street corners groups of people were reading
papers talking excitedly or staring at these unusual sunday visitors
they seemed to increase as night drew on until at last the roads my
brother said were like epsom high street on a derby day my brother
addressed several of these fugitives and got unsatisfactory answers
from most
none of them could tell him any news of woking except one man who
assured him that woking had been entirely destroyed on the previous
night
“i come from byfleet” he said; “a man on a bicycle came through the
place in the early morning and ran from door to door warning us to
come away then came soldiers we went out to look and there were
clouds of smoke to the south—nothing but smoke and not a soul coming
that way then we heard the guns at chertsey and folks coming from
weybridge so i’ve locked up my house and come on”
at that time there was a strong feeling in the streets that the
authorities were to blame for their incapacity to dispose of the
invaders without all this inconvenience
about eight o’clock a noise of heavy firing was distinctly audible all
over the south of london my brother could not hear it for the traffic
in the main thoroughfares but by striking through the quiet back
streets to the river he was able to distinguish it quite plainly
he walked from westminster to his apartments near regent’s park about
two he was now very anxious on my account and disturbed at the
evident magnitude of the trouble his mind was inclined to run even as
mine had run on saturday on military details he thought of all those
silent expectant guns of the suddenly nomadic countryside; he tried
to imagine “boilers on stilts” a hundred feet high
there were one or two cartloads of refugees passing along oxford
street and several in the marylebone road but so slowly was the news
spreading that regent street and portland place were full of their
usual sunday-night promenaders albeit they talked in groups and along
the edge of regent’s park there were as many silent couples “walking
out” together under the scattered gas lamps as ever there had been the
night was warm and still and a little oppressive; the sound of guns
continued intermittently and after midnight there seemed to be sheet
lightning in the south
he read and re-read the paper fearing the worst had happened to me he
was restless and after supper prowled out again aimlessly he returned
and tried in vain to divert his attention to his examination notes he
went to bed a little after midnight and was awakened from lurid dreams
in the small hours of monday by the sound of door knockers feet
running in the street distant drumming and a clamour of bells red
reflections danced on the ceiling for a moment he lay astonished
wondering whether day had come or the world gone mad then he jumped
out of bed and ran to the window
his room was an attic and as he thrust his head out up and down the
street there were a dozen echoes to the noise of his window sash and
heads in every kind of night disarray appeared enquiries were being
shouted “they are coming!” bawled a policeman hammering at the door;
“the martians are coming!” and hurried to the next door
the sound of drumming and trumpeting came from the albany street
barracks and every church within earshot was hard at work killing
sleep with a vehement disorderly tocsin there was a noise of doors
opening and window after window in the houses opposite flashed from
darkness into yellow illumination
up the street came galloping a closed carriage bursting abruptly into
noise at the corner rising to a clattering climax under the window
and dying away slowly in the distance close on the rear of this came a
couple of cabs the forerunners of a long procession of flying
vehicles going for the most part to chalk farm station where the
north-western special trains were loading up instead of coming down
the gradient into euston
for a long time my brother stared out of the window in blank
astonishment watching the policemen hammering at door after door and
delivering their incomprehensible message then the door behind him
opened and the man who lodged across the landing came in dressed only
in shirt trousers and slippers his braces loose about his waist his
hair disordered from his pillow
“what the devil is it” he asked “a fire what a devil of a row!”
they both craned their heads out of the window straining to hear what
the policemen were shouting people were coming out of the side
streets and standing in groups at the corners talking
“what the devil is it all about” said my brother’s fellow lodger
my brother answered him vaguely and began to dress running with each
garment to the window in order to miss nothing of the growing
excitement and presently men selling unnaturally early newspapers came
bawling into the street:
“london in danger of suffocation! the kingston and richmond defences
forced! fearful massacres in the thames valley!”
and all about him—in the rooms below in the houses on each side and
across the road and behind in the park terraces and in the hundred
other streets of that part of marylebone and the westbourne park
district and st pancras and westward and northward in kilburn and st
john’s wood and hampstead and eastward in shoreditch and highbury and
haggerston and hoxton and indeed through all the vastness of london
from ealing to east ham—people were rubbing their eyes and opening
windows to stare out and ask aimless questions dressing hastily as the
first breath of the coming storm of fear blew through the streets it
was the dawn of the great panic london which had gone to bed on
sunday night oblivious and inert was awakened in the small hours of
monday morning to a vivid sense of danger
unable from his window to learn what was happening my brother went
down and out into the street just as the sky between the parapets of
the houses grew pink with the early dawn the flying people on foot and
in vehicles grew more numerous every moment “black smoke!” he heard
people crying and again “black smoke!” the contagion of such a
unanimous fear was inevitable as my brother hesitated on the
door-step he saw another newsvendor approaching and got a paper
forthwith the man was running away with the rest and selling his
papers for a shilling each as he ran—a grotesque mingling of profit and
panic
and from this paper my brother read that catastrophic dispatch of the
commander-in-chief:
“the martians are able to discharge enormous clouds of a black and
poisonous vapour by means of rockets they have smothered our
batteries destroyed richmond kingston and wimbledon and are
advancing slowly towards london destroying everything on the way it
is impossible to stop them there is no safety from the black smoke but
in instant flight”
that was all but it was enough the whole population of the great
six-million city was stirring slipping running; presently it would be
pouring _en masse_ northward
“black smoke!” the voices cried “fire!”
the bells of the neighbouring church made a jangling tumult a cart
carelessly driven smashed amid shrieks and curses against the water
trough up the street sickly yellow lights went to and fro in the
houses and some of the passing cabs flaunted unextinguished lamps and
overhead the dawn was growing brighter clear and steady and calm
he heard footsteps running to and fro in the rooms and up and down
stairs behind him his landlady came to the door loosely wrapped in
dressing gown and shawl; her husband followed ejaculating
as my brother began to realise the import of all these things he
turned hastily to his own room put all his available money—some ten
pounds altogether—into his pockets and went out again into the
streets
xv
what had happened in surrey
it was while the curate had sat and talked so wildly to me under the
hedge in the flat meadows near halliford and while my brother was
watching the fugitives stream over westminster bridge that the
martians had resumed the offensive so far as one can ascertain from
the conflicting accounts that have been put forth the majority of them
remained busied with preparations in the horsell pit until nine that
night hurrying on some operation that disengaged huge volumes of green
smoke
but three certainly came out about eight o’clock and advancing slowly
and cautiously made their way through byfleet and pyrford towards
ripley and weybridge and so came in sight of the expectant batteries
against the setting sun these martians did not advance in a body but
in a line each perhaps a mile and a half from his nearest fellow they
communicated with one another by means of sirenlike howls running up
and down the scale from one note to another
it was this howling and firing of the guns at ripley and st george’s
hill that we had heard at upper halliford the ripley gunners
unseasoned artillery volunteers who ought never to have been placed in
such a position fired one wild premature ineffectual volley and
bolted on horse and foot through the deserted village while the
martian without using his heat-ray walked serenely over their guns
stepped gingerly among them passed in front of them and so came
unexpectedly upon the guns in painshill park which he destroyed
the st george’s hill men however were better led or of a better
mettle hidden by a pine wood as they were they seem to have been
quite unsuspected by the martian nearest to them they laid their guns
as deliberately as if they had been on parade and fired at about a
thousand yards’ range
the shells flashed all round him and he was seen to advance a few
paces stagger and go down everybody yelled together and the guns
were reloaded in frantic haste the overthrown martian set up a
prolonged ululation and immediately a second glittering giant
answering him appeared over the trees to the south it would seem that
a leg of the tripod had been smashed by one of the shells the whole of
the second volley flew wide of the martian on the ground and
simultaneously both his companions brought their heat-rays to bear on
the battery the ammunition blew up the pine trees all about the guns
flashed into fire and only one or two of the men who were already
running over the crest of the hill escaped
after this it would seem that the three took counsel together and
halted and the scouts who were watching them report that they remained
absolutely stationary for the next half hour the martian who had been
overthrown crawled tediously out of his hood a small brown figure
oddly suggestive from that distance of a speck of blight and
apparently engaged in the repair of his support about nine he had
finished for his cowl was then seen above the trees again
it was a few minutes past nine that night when these three sentinels
were joined by four other martians each carrying a thick black tube a
similar tube was handed to each of the three and the seven proceeded
to distribute themselves at equal distances along a curved line between
st george’s hill weybridge and the village of send southwest of
ripley
a dozen rockets sprang out of the hills before them so soon as they
began to move and warned the waiting batteries about ditton and esher
at the same time four of their fighting machines similarly armed with
tubes crossed the river and two of them black against the western
sky came into sight of myself and the curate as we hurried wearily and
painfully along the road that runs northward out of halliford they
moved as it seemed to us upon a cloud for a milky mist covered the
fields and rose to a third of their height
at this sight the curate cried faintly in his throat and began
running; but i knew it was no good running from a martian and i turned
aside and crawled through dewy nettles and brambles into the broad
ditch by the side of the road he looked back saw what i was doing
and turned to join me
the two halted the nearer to us standing and facing sunbury the
remoter being a grey indistinctness towards the evening star away
towards staines
the occasional howling of the martians had ceased; they took up their
positions in the huge crescent about their cylinders in absolute
silence it was a crescent with twelve miles between its horns never
since the devising of gunpowder was the beginning of a battle so still
to us and to an observer about ripley it would have had precisely the
same effect—the martians seemed in solitary possession of the darkling
night lit only as it was by the slender moon the stars the afterglow
of the daylight and the ruddy glare from st george’s hill and the
woods of painshill
but facing that crescent everywhere—at staines hounslow ditton
esher ockham behind hills and woods south of the river and across
the flat grass meadows to the north of it wherever a cluster of trees
or village houses gave sufficient cover—the guns were waiting the
signal rockets burst and rained their sparks through the night and
vanished and the spirit of all those watching batteries rose to a
tense expectation the martians had but to advance into the line of
fire and instantly those motionless black forms of men those guns
glittering so darkly in the early night would explode into a
thunderous fury of battle
no doubt the thought that was uppermost in a thousand of those vigilant
minds even as it was uppermost in mine was the riddle—how much they
understood of us did they grasp that we in our millions were
organized disciplined working together or did they interpret our
spurts of fire the sudden stinging of our shells our steady
investment of their encampment as we should the furious unanimity of
onslaught in a disturbed hive of bees did they dream they might
exterminate us (at that time no one knew what food they needed) a
hundred such questions struggled together in my mind as i watched that
vast sentinel shape and in the back of my mind was the sense of all
the huge unknown and hidden forces londonward had they prepared
pitfalls were the powder mills at hounslow ready as a snare would the
londoners have the heart and courage to make a greater moscow of their
mighty province of houses
then after an interminable time as it seemed to us crouching and
peering through the hedge came a sound like the distant concussion of
a gun another nearer and then another and then the martian beside us
raised his tube on high and discharged it gunwise with a heavy report
that made the ground heave the one towards staines answered him there
was no flash no smoke simply that loaded detonation
i was so excited by these heavy minute-guns following one another that
i so far forgot my personal safety and my scalded hands as to clamber
up into the hedge and stare towards sunbury as i did so a second
report followed and a big projectile hurtled overhead towards
hounslow i expected at least to see smoke or fire or some such
evidence of its work but all i saw was the deep blue sky above with
one solitary star and the white mist spreading wide and low beneath
and there had been no crash no answering explosion the silence was
restored; the minute lengthened to three
“what has happened” said the curate standing up beside me
“heaven knows!” said i
a bat flickered by and vanished a distant tumult of shouting began and
ceased i looked again at the martian and saw he was now moving
eastward along the riverbank with a swift rolling motion
every moment i expected the fire of some hidden battery to spring upon
him; but the evening calm was unbroken the figure of the martian grew
smaller as he receded and presently the mist and the gathering night
had swallowed him up by a common impulse we clambered higher towards
sunbury was a dark appearance as though a conical hill had suddenly
come into being there hiding our view of the farther country; and
then remoter across the river over walton we saw another such
summit these hill-like forms grew lower and broader even as we stared
moved by a sudden thought i looked northward and there i perceived a
third of these cloudy black kopjes had risen
everything had suddenly become very still far away to the southeast
marking the quiet we heard the martians hooting to one another and
then the air quivered again with the distant thud of their guns but
the earthly artillery made no reply
now at the time we could not understand these things but later i was
to learn the meaning of these ominous kopjes that gathered in the
twilight each of the martians standing in the great crescent i have
described had discharged by means of the gunlike tube he carried a
huge canister over whatever hill copse cluster of houses or other
possible cover for guns chanced to be in front of him some fired only
one of these some two—as in the case of the one we had seen; the one
at ripley is said to have discharged no fewer than five at that time
these canisters smashed on striking the ground—they did not explode—and
incontinently disengaged an enormous volume of heavy inky vapour
coiling and pouring upward in a huge and ebony cumulus cloud a gaseous
hill that sank and spread itself slowly over the surrounding country
and the touch of that vapour the inhaling of its pungent wisps was
death to all that breathes
it was heavy this vapour heavier than the densest smoke so that
after the first tumultuous uprush and outflow of its impact it sank
down through the air and poured over the ground in a manner rather
liquid than gaseous abandoning the hills and streaming into the
valleys and ditches and watercourses even as i have heard the
carbonic-acid gas that pours from volcanic clefts is wont to do and
where it came upon water some chemical action occurred and the surface
would be instantly covered with a powdery scum that sank slowly and
made way for more the scum was absolutely insoluble and it is a
strange thing seeing the instant effect of the gas that one could
drink without hurt the water from which it had been strained the
vapour did not diffuse as a true gas would do it hung together in
banks flowing sluggishly down the slope of the land and driving
reluctantly before the wind and very slowly it combined with the mist
and moisture of the air and sank to the earth in the form of dust
save that an unknown element giving a group of four lines in the blue
of the spectrum is concerned we are still entirely ignorant of the
nature of this substance
once the tumultuous upheaval of its dispersion was over the black
smoke clung so closely to the ground even before its precipitation
that fifty feet up in the air on the roofs and upper stories of high
houses and on great trees there was a chance of escaping its poison
altogether as was proved even that night at street cobham and ditton
the man who escaped at the former place tells a wonderful story of the
strangeness of its coiling flow and how he looked down from the church
spire and saw the houses of the village rising like ghosts out of its
inky nothingness for a day and a half he remained there weary
starving and sun-scorched the earth under the blue sky and against the
prospect of the distant hills a velvet-black expanse with red roofs
green trees and later black-veiled shrubs and gates barns
outhouses and walls rising here and there into the sunlight
but that was at street cobham where the black vapour was allowed to
remain until it sank of its own accord into the ground as a rule the
martians when it had served its purpose cleared the air of it again
by wading into it and directing a jet of steam upon it
this they did with the vapour banks near us as we saw in the starlight
from the window of a deserted house at upper halliford whither we had
returned from there we could see the searchlights on richmond hill and
kingston hill going to and fro and about eleven the windows rattled
and we heard the sound of the huge siege guns that had been put in
position there these continued intermittently for the space of a
quarter of an hour sending chance shots at the invisible martians at
hampton and ditton and then the pale beams of the electric light
vanished and were replaced by a bright red glow
then the fourth cylinder fell—a brilliant green meteor—as i learned
afterwards in bushey park before the guns on the richmond and
kingston line of hills began there was a fitful cannonade far away in
the southwest due i believe to guns being fired haphazard before the
black vapour could overwhelm the gunners
so setting about it as methodically as men might smoke out a wasps’
nest the martians spread this strange stifling vapour over the
londonward country the horns of the crescent slowly moved apart until
at last they formed a line from hanwell to coombe and malden all night
through their destructive tubes advanced never once after the martian
at st george’s hill was brought down did they give the artillery the
ghost of a chance against them wherever there was a possibility of
guns being laid for them unseen a fresh canister of the black vapour
was discharged and where the guns were openly displayed the heat-ray
was brought to bear
by midnight the blazing trees along the slopes of richmond park and the
glare of kingston hill threw their light upon a network of black smoke
blotting out the whole valley of the thames and extending as far as the
eye could reach and through this two martians slowly waded and turned
their hissing steam jets this way and that
they were sparing of the heat-ray that night either because they had
but a limited supply of material for its production or because they did
not wish to destroy the country but only to crush and overawe the
opposition they had aroused in the latter aim they certainly
succeeded sunday night was the end of the organised opposition to
their movements after that no body of men would stand against them so
hopeless was the enterprise even the crews of the torpedo-boats and
destroyers that had brought their quick-firers up the thames refused to
stop mutinied and went down again the only offensive operation men
ventured upon after that night was the preparation of mines and
pitfalls and even in that their energies were frantic and spasmodic
one has to imagine as well as one may the fate of those batteries
towards esher waiting so tensely in the twilight survivors there were
none one may picture the orderly expectation the officers alert and
watchful the gunners ready the ammunition piled to hand the limber
gunners with their horses and waggons the groups of civilian
spectators standing as near as they were permitted the evening
stillness the ambulances and hospital tents with the burned and
wounded from weybridge; then the dull resonance of the shots the
martians fired and the clumsy projectile whirling over the trees and
houses and smashing amid the neighbouring fields
one may picture too the sudden shifting of the attention the swiftly
spreading coils and bellyings of that blackness advancing headlong
towering heavenward turning the twilight to a palpable darkness a
strange and horrible antagonist of vapour striding upon its victims
men and horses near it seen dimly running shrieking falling
headlong shouts of dismay the guns suddenly abandoned men choking
and writhing on the ground and the swift broadening-out of the opaque
cone of smoke and then night and extinction—nothing but a silent mass
of impenetrable vapour hiding its dead
before dawn the black vapour was pouring through the streets of
richmond and the disintegrating organism of government was with a
last expiring effort rousing the population of london to the necessity
of flight
xvi
the exodus from london
so you understand the roaring wave of fear that swept through the
greatest city in the world just as monday was dawning—the stream of
flight rising swiftly to a torrent lashing in a foaming tumult round
the railway stations banked up into a horrible struggle about the
shipping in the thames and hurrying by every available channel
northward and eastward by ten o’clock the police organisation and by
midday even the railway organisations were losing coherency losing
shape and efficiency guttering softening running at last in that
swift liquefaction of the social body
all the railway lines north of the thames and the south-eastern people
at cannon street had been warned by midnight on sunday and trains were
being filled people were fighting savagely for standing-room in the
carriages even at two o’clock by three people were being trampled and
crushed even in bishopsgate street a couple of hundred yards or more
from liverpool street station; revolvers were fired people stabbed
and the policemen who had been sent to direct the traffic exhausted
and infuriated were breaking the heads of the people they were called
out to protect
and as the day advanced and the engine drivers and stokers refused to
return to london the pressure of the flight drove the people in an
ever-thickening multitude away from the stations and along the
northward-running roads by midday a martian had been seen at barnes
and a cloud of slowly sinking black vapour drove along the thames and
across the flats of lambeth cutting off all escape over the bridges in
its sluggish advance another bank drove over ealing and surrounded a
little island of survivors on castle hill alive but unable to escape
after a fruitless struggle to get aboard a north-western train at chalk
farm—the engines of the trains that had loaded in the goods yard there
_ploughed_ through shrieking people and a dozen stalwart men fought to
keep the crowd from crushing the driver against his furnace—my brother
emerged upon the chalk farm road dodged across through a hurrying
swarm of vehicles and had the luck to be foremost in the sack of a
cycle shop the front tire of the machine he got was punctured in
dragging it through the window but he got up and off notwithstanding
with no further injury than a cut wrist the steep foot of haverstock
hill was impassable owing to several overturned horses and my brother
struck into belsize road
so he got out of the fury of the panic and skirting the edgware road
reached edgware about seven fasting and wearied but well ahead of the
crowd along the road people were standing in the roadway curious
wondering he was passed by a number of cyclists some horsemen and
two motor cars a mile from edgware the rim of the wheel broke and the
machine became unridable he left it by the roadside and trudged
through the village there were shops half opened in the main street of
the place and people crowded on the pavement and in the doorways and
windows staring astonished at this extraordinary procession of
fugitives that was beginning he succeeded in getting some food at an
inn
for a time he remained in edgware not knowing what next to do the
flying people increased in number many of them like my brother
seemed inclined to loiter in the place there was no fresh news of the
invaders from mars
at that time the road was crowded but as yet far from congested most
of the fugitives at that hour were mounted on cycles but there were
soon motor cars hansom cabs and carriages hurrying along and the
dust hung in heavy clouds along the road to st albans
it was perhaps a vague idea of making his way to chelmsford where some
friends of his lived that at last induced my brother to strike into a
quiet lane running eastward presently he came upon a stile and
crossing it followed a footpath northeastward he passed near several
farmhouses and some little places whose names he did not learn he saw
few fugitives until in a grass lane towards high barnet he happened
upon two ladies who became his fellow travellers he came upon them
just in time to save them
he heard their screams and hurrying round the corner saw a couple of
men struggling to drag them out of the little pony-chaise in which they
had been driving while a third with difficulty held the frightened
pony’s head one of the ladies a short woman dressed in white was
simply screaming; the other a dark slender figure slashed at the man
who gripped her arm with a whip she held in her disengaged hand
my brother immediately grasped the situation shouted and hurried
towards the struggle one of the men desisted and turned towards him
and my brother realising from his antagonist’s face that a fight was
unavoidable and being an expert boxer went into him forthwith and
sent him down against the wheel of the chaise
it was no time for pugilistic chivalry and my brother laid him quiet
with a kick and gripped the collar of the man who pulled at the
slender lady’s arm he heard the clatter of hoofs the whip stung
across his face a third antagonist struck him between the eyes and
the man he held wrenched himself free and made off down the lane in the
direction from which he had come
partly stunned he found himself facing the man who had held the
horse’s head and became aware of the chaise receding from him down the
lane swaying from side to side and with the women in it looking back
the man before him a burly rough tried to close and he stopped him
with a blow in the face then realising that he was deserted he
dodged round and made off down the lane after the chaise with the
sturdy man close behind him and the fugitive who had turned now
following remotely
suddenly he stumbled and fell; his immediate pursuer went headlong and
he rose to his feet to find himself with a couple of antagonists again
he would have had little chance against them had not the slender lady
very pluckily pulled up and returned to his help it seems she had had
a revolver all this time but it had been under the seat when she and
her companion were attacked she fired at six yards’ distance narrowly
missing my brother the less courageous of the robbers made off and
his companion followed him cursing his cowardice they both stopped in
sight down the lane where the third man lay insensible
“take this!” said the slender lady and she gave my brother her
revolver
“go back to the chaise” said my brother wiping the blood from his
split lip
she turned without a word—they were both panting—and they went back to
where the lady in white struggled to hold back the frightened pony
the robbers had evidently had enough of it when my brother looked
again they were retreating
“i’ll sit here” said my brother “if i may”; and he got upon the empty
front seat the lady looked over her shoulder
“give me the reins” she said and laid the whip along the pony’s side
in another moment a bend in the road hid the three men from my
brother’s eyes
so quite unexpectedly my brother found himself panting with a cut
mouth a bruised jaw and bloodstained knuckles driving along an
unknown lane with these two women
he learned they were the wife and the younger sister of a surgeon
living at stanmore who had come in the small hours from a dangerous
case at pinner and heard at some railway station on his way of the
martian advance he had hurried home roused the women—their servant
had left them two days before—packed some provisions put his revolver
under the seat—luckily for my brother—and told them to drive on to
edgware with the idea of getting a train there he stopped behind to
tell the neighbours he would overtake them he said at about half
past four in the morning and now it was nearly nine and they had seen
nothing of him they could not stop in edgware because of the growing
traffic through the place and so they had come into this side lane
that was the story they told my brother in fragments when presently
they stopped again nearer to new barnet he promised to stay with
them at least until they could determine what to do or until the
missing man arrived and professed to be an expert shot with the
revolver—a weapon strange to him—in order to give them confidence
they made a sort of encampment by the wayside and the pony became
happy in the hedge he told them of his own escape out of london and
all that he knew of these martians and their ways the sun crept higher
in the sky and after a time their talk died out and gave place to an
uneasy state of anticipation several wayfarers came along the lane
and of these my brother gathered such news as he could every broken
answer he had deepened his impression of the great disaster that had
come on humanity deepened his persuasion of the immediate necessity
for prosecuting this flight he urged the matter upon them
“we have money” said the slender woman and hesitated
her eyes met my brother’s and her hesitation ended
“so have i” said my brother
she explained that they had as much as thirty pounds in gold besides a
five-pound note and suggested that with that they might get upon a
train at st albans or new barnet my brother thought that was
hopeless seeing the fury of the londoners to crowd upon the trains
and broached his own idea of striking across essex towards harwich and
thence escaping from the country altogether
mrs elphinstone—that was the name of the woman in white—would listen
to no reasoning and kept calling upon “george”; but her sister-in-law
was astonishingly quiet and deliberate and at last agreed to my
brother’s suggestion so designing to cross the great north road they
went on towards barnet my brother leading the pony to save it as much
as possible as the sun crept up the sky the day became excessively
hot and under foot a thick whitish sand grew burning and blinding so
that they travelled only very slowly the hedges were grey with dust
and as they advanced towards barnet a tumultuous murmuring grew
stronger
they began to meet more people for the most part these were staring
before them murmuring indistinct questions jaded haggard unclean
one man in evening dress passed them on foot his eyes on the ground
they heard his voice and looking back at him saw one hand clutched
in his hair and the other beating invisible things his paroxysm of
rage over he went on his way without once looking back
as my brother’s party went on towards the crossroads to the south of
barnet they saw a woman approaching the road across some fields on
their left carrying a child and with two other children; and then
passed a man in dirty black with a thick stick in one hand and a small
portmanteau in the other then round the corner of the lane from
between the villas that guarded it at its confluence with the high
road came a little cart drawn by a sweating black pony and driven by a
sallow youth in a bowler hat grey with dust there were three girls
east end factory girls and a couple of little children crowded in the
cart
“this’ll tike us rahnd edgware” asked the driver wild-eyed
white-faced; and when my brother told him it would if he turned to the
left he whipped up at once without the formality of thanks
my brother noticed a pale grey smoke or haze rising among the houses in
front of them and veiling the white façade of a terrace beyond the
road that appeared between the backs of the villas mrs elphinstone
suddenly cried out at a number of tongues of smoky red flame leaping up
above the houses in front of them against the hot blue sky the
tumultuous noise resolved itself now into the disorderly mingling of
many voices the gride of many wheels the creaking of waggons and the
staccato of hoofs the lane came round sharply not fifty yards from the
crossroads
“good heavens!” cried mrs elphinstone “what is this you are driving
us into”
my brother stopped
for the main road was a boiling stream of people a torrent of human
beings rushing northward one pressing on another a great bank of
dust white and luminous in the blaze of the sun made everything
within twenty feet of the ground grey and indistinct and was
perpetually renewed by the hurrying feet of a dense crowd of horses and
of men and women on foot and by the wheels of vehicles of every
description
“way!” my brother heard voices crying “make way!”
it was like riding into the smoke of a fire to approach the meeting
point of the lane and road; the crowd roared like a fire and the dust
was hot and pungent and indeed a little way up the road a villa was
burning and sending rolling masses of black smoke across the road to
add to the confusion
two men came past them then a dirty woman carrying a heavy bundle and
weeping a lost retriever dog with hanging tongue circled dubiously
round them scared and wretched and fled at my brother’s threat
so much as they could see of the road londonward between the houses to
the right was a tumultuous stream of dirty hurrying people pent in
between the villas on either side; the black heads the crowded forms
grew into distinctness as they rushed towards the corner hurried past
and merged their individuality again in a receding multitude that was
swallowed up at last in a cloud of dust
“go on! go on!” cried the voices “way! way!”
one man’s hands pressed on the back of another my brother stood at the
pony’s head irresistibly attracted he advanced slowly pace by pace
down the lane
edgware had been a scene of confusion chalk farm a riotous tumult but
this was a whole population in movement it is hard to imagine that
host it had no character of its own the figures poured out past the
corner and receded with their backs to the group in the lane along
the margin came those who were on foot threatened by the wheels
stumbling in the ditches blundering into one another
the carts and carriages crowded close upon one another making little
way for those swifter and more impatient vehicles that darted forward
every now and then when an opportunity showed itself of doing so
sending the people scattering against the fences and gates of the
villas
“push on!” was the cry “push on! they are coming!”
in one cart stood a blind man in the uniform of the salvation army
gesticulating with his crooked fingers and bawling “eternity!
eternity!” his voice was hoarse and very loud so that my brother could
hear him long after he was lost to sight in the dust some of the
people who crowded in the carts whipped stupidly at their horses and
quarrelled with other drivers; some sat motionless staring at nothing
with miserable eyes; some gnawed their hands with thirst or lay
prostrate in the bottoms of their conveyances the horses’ bits were
covered with foam their eyes bloodshot
there were cabs carriages shop-carts waggons beyond counting; a
mail cart a road-cleaner’s cart marked “vestry of st pancras” a huge
timber waggon crowded with roughs a brewer’s dray rumbled by with its
two near wheels splashed with fresh blood
“clear the way!” cried the voices “clear the way!”
“eter-nity! eter-nity!” came echoing down the road
there were sad haggard women tramping by well dressed with children
that cried and stumbled their dainty clothes smothered in dust their
weary faces smeared with tears with many of these came men sometimes
helpful sometimes lowering and savage fighting side by side with them
pushed some weary street outcast in faded black rags wide-eyed
loud-voiced and foul-mouthed there were sturdy workmen thrusting
their way along wretched unkempt men clothed like clerks or shopmen
struggling spasmodically; a wounded soldier my brother noticed men
dressed in the clothes of railway porters one wretched creature in a
nightshirt with a coat thrown over it
but varied as its composition was certain things all that host had in
common there were fear and pain on their faces and fear behind them
a tumult up the road a quarrel for a place in a waggon sent the whole
host of them quickening their pace; even a man so scared and broken
that his knees bent under him was galvanised for a moment into renewed
activity the heat and dust had already been at work upon this
multitude their skins were dry their lips black and cracked they
were all thirsty weary and footsore and amid the various cries one
heard disputes reproaches groans of weariness and fatigue; the voices
of most of them were hoarse and weak through it all ran a refrain:
“way! way! the martians are coming!”
few stopped and came aside from that flood the lane opened slantingly
into the main road with a narrow opening and had a delusive appearance
of coming from the direction of london yet a kind of eddy of people
drove into its mouth; weaklings elbowed out of the stream who for the
most part rested but a moment before plunging into it again a little
way down the lane with two friends bending over him lay a man with a
bare leg wrapped about with bloody rags he was a lucky man to have
friends
a little old man with a grey military moustache and a filthy black
frock coat limped out and sat down beside the trap removed his
boot—his sock was blood-stained—shook out a pebble and hobbled on
again; and then a little girl of eight or nine all alone threw
herself under the hedge close by my brother weeping
“i can’t go on! i can’t go on!”
my brother woke from his torpor of astonishment and lifted her up
speaking gently to her and carried her to miss elphinstone so soon as
my brother touched her she became quite still as if frightened
“ellen!” shrieked a woman in the crowd with tears in her
voice—“ellen!” and the child suddenly darted away from my brother
crying “mother!”
“they are coming” said a man on horseback riding past along the lane
“out of the way there!” bawled a coachman towering high; and my
brother saw a closed carriage turning into the lane
the people crushed back on one another to avoid the horse my brother
pushed the pony and chaise back into the hedge and the man drove by
and stopped at the turn of the way it was a carriage with a pole for
a pair of horses but only one was in the traces my brother saw dimly
through the dust that two men lifted out something on a white stretcher
and put it gently on the grass beneath the privet hedge
one of the men came running to my brother
“where is there any water” he said “he is dying fast and very
thirsty it is lord garrick”
“lord garrick!” said my brother; “the chief justice”
“the water” he said
“there may be a tap” said my brother “in some of the houses we have
no water i dare not leave my people”
the man pushed against the crowd towards the gate of the corner house
“go on!” said the people thrusting at him “they are coming! go on!”
then my brother’s attention was distracted by a bearded eagle-faced
man lugging a small handbag which split even as my brother’s eyes
rested on it and disgorged a mass of sovereigns that seemed to break up
into separate coins as it struck the ground they rolled hither and
thither among the struggling feet of men and horses the man stopped
and looked stupidly at the heap and the shaft of a cab struck his
shoulder and sent him reeling he gave a shriek and dodged back and a
cartwheel shaved him narrowly
“way!” cried the men all about him “make way!”
so soon as the cab had passed he flung himself with both hands open
upon the heap of coins and began thrusting handfuls in his pocket a
horse rose close upon him and in another moment half rising he had
been borne down under the horse’s hoofs
“stop!” screamed my brother and pushing a woman out of his way tried
to clutch the bit of the horse
before he could get to it he heard a scream under the wheels and saw
through the dust the rim passing over the poor wretch’s back the
driver of the cart slashed his whip at my brother who ran round behind
the cart the multitudinous shouting confused his ears the man was
writhing in the dust among his scattered money unable to rise for the
wheel had broken his back and his lower limbs lay limp and dead my
brother stood up and yelled at the next driver and a man on a black
horse came to his assistance
“get him out of the road” said he; and clutching the man’s collar
with his free hand my brother lugged him sideways but he still
clutched after his money and regarded my brother fiercely hammering
at his arm with a handful of gold “go on! go on!” shouted angry voices
behind “way! way!”
there was a smash as the pole of a carriage crashed into the cart that
the man on horseback stopped my brother looked up and the man with
the gold twisted his head round and bit the wrist that held his collar
there was a concussion and the black horse came staggering sideways
and the carthorse pushed beside it a hoof missed my brother’s foot by
a hair’s breadth he released his grip on the fallen man and jumped
back he saw anger change to terror on the face of the poor wretch on
the ground and in a moment he was hidden and my brother was borne
backward and carried past the entrance of the lane and had to fight
hard in the torrent to recover it
he saw miss elphinstone covering her eyes and a little child with all
a child’s want of sympathetic imagination staring with dilated eyes at
a dusty something that lay black and still ground and crushed under
the rolling wheels “let us go back!” he shouted and began turning the
pony round “we cannot cross this—hell” he said and they went back a
hundred yards the way they had come until the fighting crowd was
hidden as they passed the bend in the lane my brother saw the face of
the dying man in the ditch under the privet deadly white and drawn
and shining with perspiration the two women sat silent crouching in
their seat and shivering
then beyond the bend my brother stopped again miss elphinstone was
white and pale and her sister-in-law sat weeping too wretched even to
call upon “george” my brother was horrified and perplexed so soon as
they had retreated he realised how urgent and unavoidable it was to
attempt this crossing he turned to miss elphinstone suddenly
resolute
“we must go that way” he said and led the pony round again
for the second time that day this girl proved her quality to force
their way into the torrent of people my brother plunged into the
traffic and held back a cab horse while she drove the pony across its
head a waggon locked wheels for a moment and ripped a long splinter
from the chaise in another moment they were caught and swept forward
by the stream my brother with the cabman’s whip marks red across his
face and hands scrambled into the chaise and took the reins from her
“point the revolver at the man behind” he said giving it to her “if
he presses us too hard no!—point it at his horse”
then he began to look out for a chance of edging to the right across
the road but once in the stream he seemed to lose volition to become
a part of that dusty rout they swept through chipping barnet with the
torrent; they were nearly a mile beyond the centre of the town before
they had fought across to the opposite side of the way it was din and
confusion indescribable; but in and beyond the town the road forks
repeatedly and this to some extent relieved the stress
they struck eastward through hadley and there on either side of the
road and at another place farther on they came upon a great multitude
of people drinking at the stream some fighting to come at the water
and farther on from a lull near east barnet they saw two trains
running slowly one after the other without signal or order—trains
swarming with people with men even among the coals behind the
engines—going northward along the great northern railway my brother
supposes they must have filled outside london for at that time the
furious terror of the people had rendered the central termini
impossible
near this place they halted for the rest of the afternoon for the
violence of the day had already utterly exhausted all three of them
they began to suffer the beginnings of hunger; the night was cold and
none of them dared to sleep and in the evening many people came
hurrying along the road nearby their stopping place fleeing from
unknown dangers before them and going in the direction from which my
brother had come
xvii
the “thunder child”
had the martians aimed only at destruction they might on monday have
annihilated the entire population of london as it spread itself slowly
through the home counties not only along the road through barnet but
also through edgware and waltham abbey and along the roads eastward to
southend and shoeburyness and south of the thames to deal and
broadstairs poured the same frantic rout if one could have hung that
june morning in a balloon in the blazing blue above london every
northward and eastward road running out of the tangled maze of streets
would have seemed stippled black with the streaming fugitives each dot
a human agony of terror and physical distress i have set forth at
length in the last chapter my brother’s account of the road through
chipping barnet in order that my readers may realise how that swarming
of black dots appeared to one of those concerned never before in the
history of the world had such a mass of human beings moved and suffered
together the legendary hosts of goths and huns the hugest armies asia
has ever seen would have been but a drop in that current and this was
no disciplined march; it was a stampede—a stampede gigantic and
terrible—without order and without a goal six million people unarmed
and unprovisioned driving headlong it was the beginning of the rout
of civilisation of the massacre of mankind
directly below him the balloonist would have seen the network of
streets far and wide houses churches squares crescents
gardens—already derelict—spread out like a huge map and in the
southward _blotted_ over ealing richmond wimbledon it would have
seemed as if some monstrous pen had flung ink upon the chart steadily
incessantly each black splash grew and spread shooting out
ramifications this way and that now banking itself against rising
ground now pouring swiftly over a crest into a new-found valley
exactly as a gout of ink would spread itself upon blotting paper
and beyond over the blue hills that rise southward of the river the
glittering martians went to and fro calmly and methodically spreading
their poison cloud over this patch of country and then over that
laying it again with their steam jets when it had served its purpose
and taking possession of the conquered country they do not seem to
have aimed at extermination so much as at complete demoralisation and
the destruction of any opposition they exploded any stores of powder
they came upon cut every telegraph and wrecked the railways here and
there they were hamstringing mankind they seemed in no hurry to
extend the field of their operations and did not come beyond the
central part of london all that day it is possible that a very
considerable number of people in london stuck to their houses through
monday morning certain it is that many died at home suffocated by the
black smoke
until about midday the pool of london was an astonishing scene
steamboats and shipping of all sorts lay there tempted by the enormous
sums of money offered by fugitives and it is said that many who swam
out to these vessels were thrust off with boathooks and drowned about
one o’clock in the afternoon the thinning remnant of a cloud of the
black vapour appeared between the arches of blackfriars bridge at that
the pool became a scene of mad confusion fighting and collision and
for some time a multitude of boats and barges jammed in the northern
arch of the tower bridge and the sailors and lightermen had to fight
savagely against the people who swarmed upon them from the riverfront
people were actually clambering down the piers of the bridge from
above
when an hour later a martian appeared beyond the clock tower and
waded down the river nothing but wreckage floated above limehouse
of the falling of the fifth cylinder i have presently to tell the
sixth star fell at wimbledon my brother keeping watch beside the
women in the chaise in a meadow saw the green flash of it far beyond
the hills on tuesday the little party still set upon getting across
the sea made its way through the swarming country towards colchester
the news that the martians were now in possession of the whole of
london was confirmed they had been seen at highgate and even it was
said at neasden but they did not come into my brother’s view until
the morrow
that day the scattered multitudes began to realise the urgent need of
provisions as they grew hungry the rights of property ceased to be
regarded farmers were out to defend their cattle-sheds granaries and
ripening root crops with arms in their hands a number of people now
like my brother had their faces eastward and there were some
desperate souls even going back towards london to get food these were
chiefly people from the northern suburbs whose knowledge of the black
smoke came by hearsay he heard that about half the members of the
government had gathered at birmingham and that enormous quantities of
high explosives were being prepared to be used in automatic mines
across the midland counties
he was also told that the midland railway company had replaced the
desertions of the first day’s panic had resumed traffic and was
running northward trains from st albans to relieve the congestion of
the home counties there was also a placard in chipping ongar
announcing that large stores of flour were available in the northern
towns and that within twenty-four hours bread would be distributed
among the starving people in the neighbourhood but this intelligence
did not deter him from the plan of escape he had formed and the three
pressed eastward all day and heard no more of the bread distribution
than this promise nor as a matter of fact did anyone else hear more
of it that night fell the seventh star falling upon primrose hill it
fell while miss elphinstone was watching for she took that duty
alternately with my brother she saw it
on wednesday the three fugitives—they had passed the night in a field
of unripe wheat—reached chelmsford and there a body of the
inhabitants calling itself the committee of public supply seized the
pony as provisions and would give nothing in exchange for it but the
promise of a share in it the next day here there were rumours of
martians at epping and news of the destruction of waltham abbey powder
mills in a vain attempt to blow up one of the invaders
people were watching for martians here from the church towers my
brother very luckily for him as it chanced preferred to push on at
once to the coast rather than wait for food although all three of them
were very hungry by midday they passed through tillingham which
strangely enough seemed to be quite silent and deserted save for a
few furtive plunderers hunting for food near tillingham they suddenly
came in sight of the sea and the most amazing crowd of shipping of all
sorts that it is possible to imagine
for after the sailors could no longer come up the thames they came on
to the essex coast to harwich and walton and clacton and afterwards
to foulness and shoebury to bring off the people they lay in a huge
sickle-shaped curve that vanished into mist at last towards the naze
close inshore was a multitude of fishing smacks—english scotch
french dutch and swedish; steam launches from the thames yachts
electric boats; and beyond were ships of larger burden a multitude of
filthy colliers trim merchantmen cattle ships passenger boats
petroleum tanks ocean tramps an old white transport even neat white
and grey liners from southampton and hamburg; and along the blue coast
across the blackwater my brother could make out dimly a dense swarm of
boats chaffering with the people on the beach a swarm which also
extended up the blackwater almost to maldon
about a couple of miles out lay an ironclad very low in the water
almost to my brother’s perception like a water-logged ship this was
the ram _thunder child_ it was the only warship in sight but far away
to the right over the smooth surface of the sea—for that day there was
a dead calm—lay a serpent of black smoke to mark the next ironclads of
the channel fleet which hovered in an extended line steam up and
ready for action across the thames estuary during the course of the
martian conquest vigilant and yet powerless to prevent it
at the sight of the sea mrs elphinstone in spite of the assurances
of her sister-in-law gave way to panic she had never been out of
england before she would rather die than trust herself friendless in a
foreign country and so forth she seemed poor woman to imagine that
the french and the martians might prove very similar she had been
growing increasingly hysterical fearful and depressed during the two
days’ journeyings her great idea was to return to stanmore things had
been always well and safe at stanmore they would find george at
stanmore
it was with the greatest difficulty they could get her down to the
beach where presently my brother succeeded in attracting the attention
of some men on a paddle steamer from the thames they sent a boat and
drove a bargain for thirty-six pounds for the three the steamer was
going these men said to ostend
it was about two o’clock when my brother having paid their fares at
the gangway found himself safely aboard the steamboat with his
charges there was food aboard albeit at exorbitant prices and the
three of them contrived to eat a meal on one of the seats forward
there were already a couple of score of passengers aboard some of whom
had expended their last money in securing a passage but the captain
lay off the blackwater until five in the afternoon picking up
passengers until the seated decks were even dangerously crowded he
would probably have remained longer had it not been for the sound of
guns that began about that hour in the south as if in answer the
ironclad seaward fired a small gun and hoisted a string of flags a jet
of smoke sprang out of her funnels
some of the passengers were of opinion that this firing came from
shoeburyness until it was noticed that it was growing louder at the
same time far away in the southeast the masts and upperworks of three
ironclads rose one after the other out of the sea beneath clouds of
black smoke but my brother’s attention speedily reverted to the
distant firing in the south he fancied he saw a column of smoke rising
out of the distant grey haze
the little steamer was already flapping her way eastward of the big
crescent of shipping and the low essex coast was growing blue and
hazy when a martian appeared small and faint in the remote distance
advancing along the muddy coast from the direction of foulness at that
the captain on the bridge swore at the top of his voice with fear and
anger at his own delay and the paddles seemed infected with his
terror every soul aboard stood at the bulwarks or on the seats of the
steamer and stared at that distant shape higher than the trees or
church towers inland and advancing with a leisurely parody of a human
stride
it was the first martian my brother had seen and he stood more amazed
than terrified watching this titan advancing deliberately towards the
shipping wading farther and farther into the water as the coast fell
away then far away beyond the crouch came another striding over
some stunted trees and then yet another still farther off wading
deeply through a shiny mudflat that seemed to hang halfway up between
sea and sky they were all stalking seaward as if to intercept the
escape of the multitudinous vessels that were crowded between foulness
and the naze in spite of the throbbing exertions of the engines of the
little paddle-boat and the pouring foam that her wheels flung behind
her she receded with terrifying slowness from this ominous advance
glancing northwestward my brother saw the large crescent of shipping
already writhing with the approaching terror; one ship passing behind
another another coming round from broadside to end on steamships
whistling and giving off volumes of steam sails being let out
launches rushing hither and thither he was so fascinated by this and
by the creeping danger away to the left that he had no eyes for
anything seaward and then a swift movement of the steamboat (she had
suddenly come round to avoid being run down) flung him headlong from
the seat upon which he was standing there was a shouting all about
him a trampling of feet and a cheer that seemed to be answered
faintly the steamboat lurched and rolled him over upon his hands
he sprang to his feet and saw to starboard and not a hundred yards
from their heeling pitching boat a vast iron bulk like the blade of a
plough tearing through the water tossing it on either side in huge
waves of foam that leaped towards the steamer flinging her paddles
helplessly in the air and then sucking her deck down almost to the
waterline
a douche of spray blinded my brother for a moment when his eyes were
clear again he saw the monster had passed and was rushing landward big
iron upperworks rose out of this headlong structure and from that twin
funnels projected and spat a smoking blast shot with fire it was the
torpedo ram _thunder child_ steaming headlong coming to the rescue
of the threatened shipping
keeping his footing on the heaving deck by clutching the bulwarks my
brother looked past this charging leviathan at the martians again and
he saw the three of them now close together and standing so far out to
sea that their tripod supports were almost entirely submerged thus
sunken and seen in remote perspective they appeared far less
formidable than the huge iron bulk in whose wake the steamer was
pitching so helplessly it would seem they were regarding this new
antagonist with astonishment to their intelligence it may be the
giant was even such another as themselves the _thunder child_ fired no
gun but simply drove full speed towards them it was probably her not
firing that enabled her to get so near the enemy as she did they did
not know what to make of her one shell and they would have sent her
to the bottom forthwith with the heat-ray
she was steaming at such a pace that in a minute she seemed halfway
between the steamboat and the martians—a diminishing black bulk against
the receding horizontal expanse of the essex coast
suddenly the foremost martian lowered his tube and discharged a
canister of the black gas at the ironclad it hit her larboard side and
glanced off in an inky jet that rolled away to seaward an unfolding
torrent of black smoke from which the ironclad drove clear to the
watchers from the steamer low in the water and with the sun in their
eyes it seemed as though she were already among the martians
they saw the gaunt figures separating and rising out of the water as
they retreated shoreward and one of them raised the camera-like
generator of the heat-ray he held it pointing obliquely downward and
a bank of steam sprang from the water at its touch it must have driven
through the iron of the ship’s side like a white-hot iron rod through
paper
a flicker of flame went up through the rising steam and then the
martian reeled and staggered in another moment he was cut down and a
great body of water and steam shot high in the air the guns of the
_thunder child_ sounded through the reek going off one after the
other and one shot splashed the water high close by the steamer
ricocheted towards the other flying ships to the north and smashed a
smack to matchwood
but no one heeded that very much at the sight of the martian’s
collapse the captain on the bridge yelled inarticulately and all the
crowding passengers on the steamer’s stern shouted together and then
they yelled again for surging out beyond the white tumult drove
something long and black the flames streaming from its middle parts
its ventilators and funnels spouting fire
she was alive still; the steering gear it seems was intact and her
engines working she headed straight for a second martian and was
within a hundred yards of him when the heat-ray came to bear then with
a violent thud a blinding flash her decks her funnels leaped
upward the martian staggered with the violence of her explosion and
in another moment the flaming wreckage still driving forward with the
impetus of its pace had struck him and crumpled him up like a thing of
cardboard my brother shouted involuntarily a boiling tumult of steam
hid everything again
“two!” yelled the captain
everyone was shouting the whole steamer from end to end rang with
frantic cheering that was taken up first by one and then by all in the
crowding multitude of ships and boats that was driving out to sea
the steam hung upon the water for many minutes hiding the third
martian and the coast altogether and all this time the boat was
paddling steadily out to sea and away from the fight; and when at last
the confusion cleared the drifting bank of black vapour intervened
and nothing of the _thunder child_ could be made out nor could the
third martian be seen but the ironclads to seaward were now quite
close and standing in towards shore past the steamboat
the little vessel continued to beat its way seaward and the ironclads
receded slowly towards the coast which was hidden still by a marbled
bank of vapour part steam part black gas eddying and combining in
the strangest way the fleet of refugees was scattering to the
northeast; several smacks were sailing between the ironclads and the
steamboat after a time and before they reached the sinking cloud
bank the warships turned northward and then abruptly went about and
passed into the thickening haze of evening southward the coast grew
faint and at last indistinguishable amid the low banks of clouds that
were gathering about the sinking sun
then suddenly out of the golden haze of the sunset came the vibration
of guns and a form of black shadows moving everyone struggled to the
rail of the steamer and peered into the blinding furnace of the west
but nothing was to be distinguished clearly a mass of smoke rose
slanting and barred the face of the sun the steamboat throbbed on its
way through an interminable suspense
the sun sank into grey clouds the sky flushed and darkened the
evening star trembled into sight it was deep twilight when the captain
cried out and pointed my brother strained his eyes something rushed
up into the sky out of the greyness—rushed slantingly upward and very
swiftly into the luminous clearness above the clouds in the western
sky; something flat and broad and very large that swept round in a
vast curve grew smaller sank slowly and vanished again into the grey
mystery of the night and as it flew it rained down darkness upon the
land
book two
the earth under the martians
i
under foot
in the first book i have wandered so much from my own adventures to
tell of the experiences of my brother that all through the last two
chapters i and the curate have been lurking in the empty house at
halliford whither we fled to escape the black smoke there i will
resume we stopped there all sunday night and all the next day—the day
of the panic—in a little island of daylight cut off by the black smoke
from the rest of the world we could do nothing but wait in aching
inactivity during those two weary days
my mind was occupied by anxiety for my wife i figured her at
leatherhead terrified in danger mourning me already as a dead man i
paced the rooms and cried aloud when i thought of how i was cut off
from her of all that might happen to her in my absence my cousin i
knew was brave enough for any emergency but he was not the sort of man
to realise danger quickly to rise promptly what was needed now was
not bravery but circumspection my only consolation was to believe
that the martians were moving londonward and away from her such vague
anxieties keep the mind sensitive and painful i grew very weary and
irritable with the curate’s perpetual ejaculations; i tired of the
sight of his selfish despair after some ineffectual remonstrance i
kept away from him staying in a room—evidently a children’s
schoolroom—containing globes forms and copybooks when he followed me
thither i went to a box room at the top of the house and in order to
be alone with my aching miseries locked myself in
we were hopelessly hemmed in by the black smoke all that day and the
morning of the next there were signs of people in the next house on
sunday evening—a face at a window and moving lights and later the
slamming of a door but i do not know who these people were nor what
became of them we saw nothing of them next day the black smoke
drifted slowly riverward all through monday morning creeping nearer
and nearer to us driving at last along the roadway outside the house
that hid us
a martian came across the fields about midday laying the stuff with a
jet of superheated steam that hissed against the walls smashed all the
windows it touched and scalded the curate’s hand as he fled out of the
front room when at last we crept across the sodden rooms and looked
out again the country northward was as though a black snowstorm had
passed over it looking towards the river we were astonished to see an
unaccountable redness mingling with the black of the scorched meadows
for a time we did not see how this change affected our position save
that we were relieved of our fear of the black smoke but later i
perceived that we were no longer hemmed in that now we might get away
so soon as i realised that the way of escape was open my dream of
action returned but the curate was lethargic unreasonable
“we are safe here” he repeated; “safe here”
i resolved to leave him—would that i had! wiser now for the
artilleryman’s teaching i sought out food and drink i had found oil
and rags for my burns and i also took a hat and a flannel shirt that i
found in one of the bedrooms when it was clear to him that i meant to
go alone—had reconciled myself to going alone—he suddenly roused
himself to come and all being quiet throughout the afternoon we
started about five o’clock as i should judge along the blackened road
to sunbury
in sunbury and at intervals along the road were dead bodies lying in
contorted attitudes horses as well as men overturned carts and
luggage all covered thickly with black dust that pall of cindery
powder made me think of what i had read of the destruction of pompeii
we got to hampton court without misadventure our minds full of strange
and unfamiliar appearances and at hampton court our eyes were relieved
to find a patch of green that had escaped the suffocating drift we
went through bushey park with its deer going to and fro under the
chestnuts and some men and women hurrying in the distance towards
hampton and so we came to twickenham these were the first people we
saw
away across the road the woods beyond ham and petersham were still
afire twickenham was uninjured by either heat-ray or black smoke and
there were more people about here though none could give us news for
the most part they were like ourselves taking advantage of a lull to
shift their quarters i have an impression that many of the houses here
were still occupied by scared inhabitants too frightened even for
flight here too the evidence of a hasty rout was abundant along the
road i remember most vividly three smashed bicycles in a heap pounded
into the road by the wheels of subsequent carts we crossed richmond
bridge about half past eight we hurried across the exposed bridge of
course but i noticed floating down the stream a number of red masses
some many feet across i did not know what these were—there was no time
for scrutiny—and i put a more horrible interpretation on them than they
deserved here again on the surrey side were black dust that had once
been smoke and dead bodies—a heap near the approach to the station;
but we had no glimpse of the martians until we were some way towards
barnes
we saw in the blackened distance a group of three people running down a
side street towards the river but otherwise it seemed deserted up the
hill richmond town was burning briskly; outside the town of richmond
there was no trace of the black smoke
then suddenly as we approached kew came a number of people running
and the upperworks of a martian fighting-machine loomed in sight over
the housetops not a hundred yards away from us we stood aghast at our
danger and had the martian looked down we must immediately have
perished we were so terrified that we dared not go on but turned
aside and hid in a shed in a garden there the curate crouched weeping
silently and refusing to stir again
but my fixed idea of reaching leatherhead would not let me rest and in
the twilight i ventured out again i went through a shrubbery and
along a passage beside a big house standing in its own grounds and so
emerged upon the road towards kew the curate i left in the shed but
he came hurrying after me
that second start was the most foolhardy thing i ever did for it was
manifest the martians were about us no sooner had the curate overtaken
me than we saw either the fighting-machine we had seen before or
another far away across the meadows in the direction of kew lodge
four or five little black figures hurried before it across the
green-grey of the field and in a moment it was evident this martian
pursued them in three strides he was among them and they ran
radiating from his feet in all directions he used no heat-ray to
destroy them but picked them up one by one apparently he tossed them
into the great metallic carrier which projected behind him much as a
workman’s basket hangs over his shoulder
it was the first time i realised that the martians might have any other
purpose than destruction with defeated humanity we stood for a moment
petrified then turned and fled through a gate behind us into a walled
garden fell into rather than found a fortunate ditch and lay there
scarce daring to whisper to each other until the stars were out
i suppose it was nearly eleven o’clock before we gathered courage to
start again no longer venturing into the road but sneaking along
hedgerows and through plantations and watching keenly through the
darkness he on the right and i on the left for the martians who
seemed to be all about us in one place we blundered upon a scorched
and blackened area now cooling and ashen and a number of scattered
dead bodies of men burned horribly about the heads and trunks but with
their legs and boots mostly intact; and of dead horses fifty feet
perhaps behind a line of four ripped guns and smashed gun carriages
sheen it seemed had escaped destruction but the place was silent and
deserted here we happened on no dead though the night was too dark
for us to see into the side roads of the place in sheen my companion
suddenly complained of faintness and thirst and we decided to try one
of the houses
the first house we entered after a little difficulty with the window
was a small semi-detached villa and i found nothing eatable left in
the place but some mouldy cheese there was however water to drink;
and i took a hatchet which promised to be useful in our next
house-breaking
we then crossed to a place where the road turns towards mortlake here
there stood a white house within a walled garden and in the pantry of
this domicile we found a store of food—two loaves of bread in a pan an
uncooked steak and the half of a ham i give this catalogue so
precisely because as it happened we were destined to subsist upon
this store for the next fortnight bottled beer stood under a shelf
and there were two bags of haricot beans and some limp lettuces this
pantry opened into a kind of wash-up kitchen and in this was firewood;
there was also a cupboard in which we found nearly a dozen of
burgundy tinned soups and salmon and two tins of biscuits
we sat in the adjacent kitchen in the dark—for we dared not strike a
light—and ate bread and ham and drank beer out of the same bottle the
curate who was still timorous and restless was now oddly enough for
pushing on and i was urging him to keep up his strength by eating when
the thing happened that was to imprison us
“it can’t be midnight yet” i said and then came a blinding glare of
vivid green light everything in the kitchen leaped out clearly
visible in green and black and vanished again and then followed such
a concussion as i have never heard before or since so close on the
heels of this as to seem instantaneous came a thud behind me a clash
of glass a crash and rattle of falling masonry all about us and the
plaster of the ceiling came down upon us smashing into a multitude of
fragments upon our heads i was knocked headlong across the floor
against the oven handle and stunned i was insensible for a long time
the curate told me and when i came to we were in darkness again and
he with a face wet as i found afterwards with blood from a cut
forehead was dabbing water over me
for some time i could not recollect what had happened then things came
to me slowly a bruise on my temple asserted itself
“are you better” asked the curate in a whisper
at last i answered him i sat up
“don’t move” he said “the floor is covered with smashed crockery from
the dresser you can’t possibly move without making a noise and i
fancy _they_ are outside”
we both sat quite silent so that we could scarcely hear each other
breathing everything seemed deadly still but once something near us
some plaster or broken brickwork slid down with a rumbling sound
outside and very near was an intermittent metallic rattle
“that!” said the curate when presently it happened again
“yes” i said “but what is it”
“a martian!” said the curate
i listened again
“it was not like the heat-ray” i said and for a time i was inclined
to think one of the great fighting-machines had stumbled against the
house as i had seen one stumble against the tower of shepperton
church
our situation was so strange and incomprehensible that for three or
four hours until the dawn came we scarcely moved and then the light
filtered in not through the window which remained black but through
a triangular aperture between a beam and a heap of broken bricks in the
wall behind us the interior of the kitchen we now saw greyly for the
first time
the window had been burst in by a mass of garden mould which flowed
over the table upon which we had been sitting and lay about our feet
outside the soil was banked high against the house at the top of the
window frame we could see an uprooted drainpipe the floor was littered
with smashed hardware; the end of the kitchen towards the house was
broken into and since the daylight shone in there it was evident the
greater part of the house had collapsed contrasting vividly with this
ruin was the neat dresser stained in the fashion pale green and with
a number of copper and tin vessels below it the wallpaper imitating
blue and white tiles and a couple of coloured supplements fluttering
from the walls above the kitchen range
as the dawn grew clearer we saw through the gap in the wall the body
of a martian standing sentinel i suppose over the still glowing
cylinder at the sight of that we crawled as circumspectly as possible
out of the twilight of the kitchen into the darkness of the scullery
abruptly the right interpretation dawned upon my mind
“the fifth cylinder” i whispered “the fifth shot from mars has
struck this house and buried us under the ruins!”
for a time the curate was silent and then he whispered:
“god have mercy upon us!”
i heard him presently whimpering to himself
save for that sound we lay quite still in the scullery; i for my part
scarce dared breathe and sat with my eyes fixed on the faint light of
the kitchen door i could just see the curate’s face a dim oval
shape and his collar and cuffs outside there began a metallic
hammering then a violent hooting and then again after a quiet
interval a hissing like the hissing of an engine these noises for
the most part problematical continued intermittently and seemed if
anything to increase in number as time wore on presently a measured
thudding and a vibration that made everything about us quiver and the
vessels in the pantry ring and shift began and continued once the
light was eclipsed and the ghostly kitchen doorway became absolutely
dark for many hours we must have crouched there silent and shivering
until our tired attention failed   
at last i found myself awake and very hungry i am inclined to believe
we must have spent the greater portion of a day before that awakening
my hunger was at a stride so insistent that it moved me to action i
told the curate i was going to seek food and felt my way towards the
pantry he made me no answer but so soon as i began eating the faint
noise i made stirred him up and i heard him crawling after me
ii
what we saw from the ruined house
after eating we crept back to the scullery and there i must have dozed
again for when presently i looked round i was alone the thudding
vibration continued with wearisome persistence i whispered for the
curate several times and at last felt my way to the door of the
kitchen it was still daylight and i perceived him across the room
lying against the triangular hole that looked out upon the martians
his shoulders were hunched so that his head was hidden from me
i could hear a number of noises almost like those in an engine shed;
and the place rocked with that beating thud through the aperture in
the wall i could see the top of a tree touched with gold and the warm
blue of a tranquil evening sky for a minute or so i remained watching
the curate and then i advanced crouching and stepping with extreme
care amid the broken crockery that littered the floor
i touched the curate’s leg and he started so violently that a mass of
plaster went sliding down outside and fell with a loud impact i
gripped his arm fearing he might cry out and for a long time we
crouched motionless then i turned to see how much of our rampart
remained the detachment of the plaster had left a vertical slit open
in the debris and by raising myself cautiously across a beam i was
able to see out of this gap into what had been overnight a quiet
suburban roadway vast indeed was the change that we beheld
the fifth cylinder must have fallen right into the midst of the house
we had first visited the building had vanished completely smashed
pulverised and dispersed by the blow the cylinder lay now far beneath
the original foundations—deep in a hole already vastly larger than the
pit i had looked into at woking the earth all round it had splashed
under that tremendous impact—“splashed” is the only word—and lay in
heaped piles that hid the masses of the adjacent houses it had behaved
exactly like mud under the violent blow of a hammer our house had
collapsed backward; the front portion even on the ground floor had
been destroyed completely; by a chance the kitchen and scullery had
escaped and stood buried now under soil and ruins closed in by tons
of earth on every side save towards the cylinder over that aspect we
hung now on the very edge of the great circular pit the martians were
engaged in making the heavy beating sound was evidently just behind
us and ever and again a bright green vapour drove up like a veil
across our peephole
the cylinder was already opened in the centre of the pit and on the
farther edge of the pit amid the smashed and gravel-heaped shrubbery
one of the great fighting-machines deserted by its occupant stood
stiff and tall against the evening sky at first i scarcely noticed the
pit and the cylinder although it has been convenient to describe them
first on account of the extraordinary glittering mechanism i saw busy
in the excavation and on account of the strange creatures that were
crawling slowly and painfully across the heaped mould near it
the mechanism it certainly was that held my attention first it was one
of those complicated fabrics that have since been called
handling-machines and the study of which has already given such an
enormous impetus to terrestrial invention as it dawned upon me first
it presented a sort of metallic spider with five jointed agile legs
and with an extraordinary number of jointed levers bars and reaching
and clutching tentacles about its body most of its arms were
retracted but with three long tentacles it was fishing out a number of
rods plates and bars which lined the covering and apparently
strengthened the walls of the cylinder these as it extracted them
were lifted out and deposited upon a level surface of earth behind it
its motion was so swift complex and perfect that at first i did not
see it as a machine in spite of its metallic glitter the
fighting-machines were coordinated and animated to an extraordinary
pitch but nothing to compare with this people who have never seen
these structures and have only the ill-imagined efforts of artists or
the imperfect descriptions of such eye-witnesses as myself to go upon
scarcely realise that living quality
i recall particularly the illustration of one of the first pamphlets to
give a consecutive account of the war the artist had evidently made a
hasty study of one of the fighting-machines and there his knowledge
ended he presented them as tilted stiff tripods without either
flexibility or subtlety and with an altogether misleading monotony of
effect the pamphlet containing these renderings had a considerable
vogue and i mention them here simply to warn the reader against the
impression they may have created they were no more like the martians i
saw in action than a dutch doll is like a human being to my mind the
pamphlet would have been much better without them
at first i say the handling-machine did not impress me as a machine
but as a crablike creature with a glittering integument the
controlling martian whose delicate tentacles actuated its movements
seeming to be simply the equivalent of the crab’s cerebral portion but
then i perceived the resemblance of its grey-brown shiny leathery
integument to that of the other sprawling bodies beyond and the true
nature of this dexterous workman dawned upon me with that realisation
my interest shifted to those other creatures the real martians
already i had had a transient impression of these and the first nausea
no longer obscured my observation moreover i was concealed and
motionless and under no urgency of action
they were i now saw the most unearthly creatures it is possible to
conceive they were huge round bodies—or rather heads—about four feet
in diameter each body having in front of it a face this face had no
nostrils—indeed the martians do not seem to have had any sense of
smell but it had a pair of very large dark-coloured eyes and just
beneath this a kind of fleshy beak in the back of this head or body—i
scarcely know how to speak of it—was the single tight tympanic surface
since known to be anatomically an ear though it must have been almost
useless in our dense air in a group round the mouth were sixteen
slender almost whiplike tentacles arranged in two bunches of eight
each these bunches have since been named rather aptly by that
distinguished anatomist professor howes the _hands_ even as i saw
these martians for the first time they seemed to be endeavouring to
raise themselves on these hands but of course with the increased
weight of terrestrial conditions this was impossible there is reason
to suppose that on mars they may have progressed upon them with some
facility
the internal anatomy i may remark here as dissection has since shown
was almost equally simple the greater part of the structure was the
brain sending enormous nerves to the eyes ear and tactile tentacles
besides this were the bulky lungs into which the mouth opened and the
heart and its vessels the pulmonary distress caused by the denser
atmosphere and greater gravitational attraction was only too evident in
the convulsive movements of the outer skin
and this was the sum of the martian organs strange as it may seem to a
human being all the complex apparatus of digestion which makes up the
bulk of our bodies did not exist in the martians they were
heads—merely heads entrails they had none they did not eat much less
digest instead they took the fresh living blood of other creatures
and _injected_ it into their own veins i have myself seen this being
done as i shall mention in its place but squeamish as i may seem i
cannot bring myself to describe what i could not endure even to
continue watching let it suffice to say blood obtained from a still
living animal in most cases from a human being was run directly by
means of a little pipette into the recipient canal   
the bare idea of this is no doubt horribly repulsive to us but at the
same time i think that we should remember how repulsive our carnivorous
habits would seem to an intelligent rabbit
the physiological advantages of the practice of injection are
undeniable if one thinks of the tremendous waste of human time and
energy occasioned by eating and the digestive process our bodies are
half made up of glands and tubes and organs occupied in turning
heterogeneous food into blood the digestive processes and their
reaction upon the nervous system sap our strength and colour our minds
men go happy or miserable as they have healthy or unhealthy livers or
sound gastric glands but the martians were lifted above all these
organic fluctuations of mood and emotion
their undeniable preference for men as their source of nourishment is
partly explained by the nature of the remains of the victims they had
brought with them as provisions from mars these creatures to judge
from the shrivelled remains that have fallen into human hands were
bipeds with flimsy silicious skeletons (almost like those of the
silicious sponges) and feeble musculature standing about six feet high
and having round erect heads and large eyes in flinty sockets two or
three of these seem to have been brought in each cylinder and all were
killed before earth was reached it was just as well for them for the
mere attempt to stand upright upon our planet would have broken every
bone in their bodies
and while i am engaged in this description i may add in this place
certain further details which although they were not all evident to us
at the time will enable the reader who is unacquainted with them to
form a clearer picture of these offensive creatures
in three other points their physiology differed strangely from ours
their organisms did not sleep any more than the heart of man sleeps
since they had no extensive muscular mechanism to recuperate that
periodical extinction was unknown to them they had little or no sense
of fatigue it would seem on earth they could never have moved without
effort yet even to the last they kept in action in twenty-four hours
they did twenty-four hours of work as even on earth is perhaps the
case with the ants
in the next place wonderful as it seems in a sexual world the
martians were absolutely without sex and therefore without any of the
tumultuous emotions that arise from that difference among men a young
martian there can now be no dispute was really born upon earth during
the war and it was found attached to its parent partially _budded_
off just as young lilybulbs bud off or like the young animals in the
fresh-water polyp
in man in all the higher terrestrial animals such a method of
increase has disappeared; but even on this earth it was certainly the
primitive method among the lower animals up even to those first
cousins of the vertebrated animals the tunicates the two processes
occur side by side but finally the sexual method superseded its
competitor altogether on mars however just the reverse has
apparently been the case
it is worthy of remark that a certain speculative writer of
quasi-scientific repute writing long before the martian invasion did
forecast for man a final structure not unlike the actual martian
condition his prophecy i remember appeared in november or december
 in a long-defunct publication the _pall mall budget_ and i
recall a caricature of it in a pre-martian periodical called _punch_
he pointed out—writing in a foolish facetious tone—that the perfection
of mechanical appliances must ultimately supersede limbs; the
perfection of chemical devices digestion; that such organs as hair
external nose teeth ears and chin were no longer essential parts of
the human being and that the tendency of natural selection would lie
in the direction of their steady diminution through the coming ages
the brain alone remained a cardinal necessity only one other part of
the body had a strong case for survival and that was the hand
“teacher and agent of the brain” while the rest of the body dwindled
the hands would grow larger
there is many a true word written in jest and here in the martians we
have beyond dispute the actual accomplishment of such a suppression of
the animal side of the organism by the intelligence to me it is quite
credible that the martians may be descended from beings not unlike
ourselves by a gradual development of brain and hands (the latter
giving rise to the two bunches of delicate tentacles at last) at the
expense of the rest of the body without the body the brain would of
course become a mere selfish intelligence without any of the
emotional substratum of the human being
the last salient point in which the systems of these creatures differed
from ours was in what one might have thought a very trivial particular
micro-organisms which cause so much disease and pain on earth have
either never appeared upon mars or martian sanitary science eliminated
them ages ago a hundred diseases all the fevers and contagions of
human life consumption cancers tumours and such morbidities never
enter the scheme of their life and speaking of the differences between
the life on mars and terrestrial life i may allude here to the curious
suggestions of the red weed
apparently the vegetable kingdom in mars instead of having green for a
dominant colour is of a vivid blood-red tint at any rate the seeds
which the martians (intentionally or accidentally) brought with them
gave rise in all cases to red-coloured growths only that known
popularly as the red weed however gained any footing in competition
with terrestrial forms the red creeper was quite a transitory growth
and few people have seen it growing for a time however the red weed
grew with astonishing vigour and luxuriance it spread up the sides of
the pit by the third or fourth day of our imprisonment and its
cactus-like branches formed a carmine fringe to the edges of our
triangular window and afterwards i found it broadcast throughout the
country and especially wherever there was a stream of water
the martians had what appears to have been an auditory organ a single
round drum at the back of the head-body and eyes with a visual range
not very different from ours except that according to philips blue
and violet were as black to them it is commonly supposed that they
communicated by sounds and tentacular gesticulations; this is asserted
for instance in the able but hastily compiled pamphlet (written
evidently by someone not an eye-witness of martian actions) to which i
have already alluded and which so far has been the chief source of
information concerning them now no surviving human being saw so much
of the martians in action as i did i take no credit to myself for an
accident but the fact is so and i assert that i watched them closely
time after time and that i have seen four five and (once) six of
them sluggishly performing the most elaborately complicated operations
together without either sound or gesture their peculiar hooting
invariably preceded feeding; it had no modulation and was i believe
in no sense a signal but merely the expiration of air preparatory to
the suctional operation i have a certain claim to at least an
elementary knowledge of psychology and in this matter i am
convinced—as firmly as i am convinced of anything—that the martians
interchanged thoughts without any physical intermediation and i have
been convinced of this in spite of strong preconceptions before the
martian invasion as an occasional reader here or there may remember i
had written with some little vehemence against the telepathic theory
the martians wore no clothing their conceptions of ornament and
decorum were necessarily different from ours; and not only were they
evidently much less sensible of changes of temperature than we are but
changes of pressure do not seem to have affected their health at all
seriously yet though they wore no clothing it was in the other
artificial additions to their bodily resources that their great
superiority over man lay we men with our bicycles and road-skates
our lilienthal soaring-machines our guns and sticks and so forth are
just in the beginning of the evolution that the martians have worked
out they have become practically mere brains wearing different bodies
according to their needs just as men wear suits of clothes and take a
bicycle in a hurry or an umbrella in the wet and of their appliances
perhaps nothing is more wonderful to a man than the curious fact that
what is the dominant feature of almost all human devices in mechanism
is absent—the _wheel_ is absent; among all the things they brought to
earth there is no trace or suggestion of their use of wheels one would
have at least expected it in locomotion and in this connection it is
curious to remark that even on this earth nature has never hit upon the
wheel or has preferred other expedients to its development and not
only did the martians either not know of (which is incredible) or
abstain from the wheel but in their apparatus singularly little use
is made of the fixed pivot or relatively fixed pivot with circular
motions thereabout confined to one plane almost all the joints of the
machinery present a complicated system of sliding parts moving over
small but beautifully curved friction bearings and while upon this
matter of detail it is remarkable that the long leverages of their
machines are in most cases actuated by a sort of sham musculature of
the disks in an elastic sheath; these disks become polarised and drawn
closely and powerfully together when traversed by a current of
electricity in this way the curious parallelism to animal motions
which was so striking and disturbing to the human beholder was
attained such quasi-muscles abounded in the crablike handling-machine
which on my first peeping out of the slit i watched unpacking the
cylinder it seemed infinitely more alive than the actual martians
lying beyond it in the sunset light panting stirring ineffectual
tentacles and moving feebly after their vast journey across space
while i was still watching their sluggish motions in the sunlight and
noting each strange detail of their form the curate reminded me of his
presence by pulling violently at my arm i turned to a scowling face
and silent eloquent lips he wanted the slit which permitted only one
of us to peep through; and so i had to forego watching them for a time
while he enjoyed that privilege
when i looked again the busy handling-machine had already put together
several of the pieces of apparatus it had taken out of the cylinder
into a shape having an unmistakable likeness to its own; and down on
the left a busy little digging mechanism had come into view emitting
jets of green vapour and working its way round the pit excavating and
embanking in a methodical and discriminating manner this it was which
had caused the regular beating noise and the rhythmic shocks that had
kept our ruinous refuge quivering it piped and whistled as it worked
so far as i could see the thing was without a directing martian at
all
iii
the days of imprisonment
the arrival of a second fighting-machine drove us from our peephole
into the scullery for we feared that from his elevation the martian
might see down upon us behind our barrier at a later date we began to
feel less in danger of their eyes for to an eye in the dazzle of the
sunlight outside our refuge must have been blank blackness but at
first the slightest suggestion of approach drove us into the scullery
in heart-throbbing retreat yet terrible as was the danger we incurred
the attraction of peeping was for both of us irresistible and i recall
now with a sort of wonder that in spite of the infinite danger in
which we were between starvation and a still more terrible death we
could yet struggle bitterly for that horrible privilege of sight we
would race across the kitchen in a grotesque way between eagerness and
the dread of making a noise and strike each other and thrust and
kick within a few inches of exposure
the fact is that we had absolutely incompatible dispositions and habits
of thought and action and our danger and isolation only accentuated
the incompatibility at halliford i had already come to hate the
curate’s trick of helpless exclamation his stupid rigidity of mind
his endless muttering monologue vitiated every effort i made to think
out a line of action and drove me at times thus pent up and
intensified almost to the verge of craziness he was as lacking in
restraint as a silly woman he would weep for hours together and i
verily believe that to the very end this spoiled child of life thought
his weak tears in some way efficacious and i would sit in the darkness
unable to keep my mind off him by reason of his importunities he ate
more than i did and it was in vain i pointed out that our only chance
of life was to stop in the house until the martians had done with their
pit that in that long patience a time might presently come when we
should need food he ate and drank impulsively in heavy meals at long
intervals he slept little
as the days wore on his utter carelessness of any consideration so
intensified our distress and danger that i had much as i loathed doing
it to resort to threats and at last to blows that brought him to
reason for a time but he was one of those weak creatures void of
pride timorous anæmic hateful souls full of shifty cunning who
face neither god nor man who face not even themselves
it is disagreeable for me to recall and write these things but i set
them down that my story may lack nothing those who have escaped the
dark and terrible aspects of life will find my brutality my flash of
rage in our final tragedy easy enough to blame; for they know what is
wrong as well as any but not what is possible to tortured men but
those who have been under the shadow who have gone down at last to
elemental things will have a wider charity
and while within we fought out our dark dim contest of whispers
snatched food and drink and gripping hands and blows without in the
pitiless sunlight of that terrible june was the strange wonder the
unfamiliar routine of the martians in the pit let me return to those
first new experiences of mine after a long time i ventured back to the
peephole to find that the new-comers had been reinforced by the
occupants of no fewer than three of the fighting-machines these last
had brought with them certain fresh appliances that stood in an orderly
manner about the cylinder the second handling-machine was now
completed and was busied in serving one of the novel contrivances the
big machine had brought this was a body resembling a milk can in its
general form above which oscillated a pear-shaped receptacle and from
which a stream of white powder flowed into a circular basin below
the oscillatory motion was imparted to this by one tentacle of the
handling-machine with two spatulate hands the handling-machine was
digging out and flinging masses of clay into the pear-shaped receptacle
above while with another arm it periodically opened a door and removed
rusty and blackened clinkers from the middle part of the machine
another steely tentacle directed the powder from the basin along a
ribbed channel towards some receiver that was hidden from me by the
mound of bluish dust from this unseen receiver a little thread of
green smoke rose vertically into the quiet air as i looked the
handling-machine with a faint and musical clinking extended
telescopic fashion a tentacle that had been a moment before a mere
blunt projection until its end was hidden behind the mound of clay in
another second it had lifted a bar of white aluminium into sight
untarnished as yet and shining dazzlingly and deposited it in a
growing stack of bars that stood at the side of the pit between sunset
and starlight this dexterous machine must have made more than a hundred
such bars out of the crude clay and the mound of bluish dust rose
steadily until it topped the side of the pit
the contrast between the swift and complex movements of these
contrivances and the inert panting clumsiness of their masters was
acute and for days i had to tell myself repeatedly that these latter
were indeed the living of the two things
the curate had possession of the slit when the first men were brought
to the pit i was sitting below huddled up listening with all my
ears he made a sudden movement backward and i fearful that we were
observed crouched in a spasm of terror he came sliding down the
rubbish and crept beside me in the darkness inarticulate
gesticulating and for a moment i shared his panic his gesture
suggested a resignation of the slit and after a little while my
curiosity gave me courage and i rose up stepped across him and
clambered up to it at first i could see no reason for his frantic
behaviour the twilight had now come the stars were little and faint
but the pit was illuminated by the flickering green fire that came from
the aluminium-making the whole picture was a flickering scheme of
green gleams and shifting rusty black shadows strangely trying to the
eyes over and through it all went the bats heeding it not at all the
sprawling martians were no longer to be seen the mound of blue-green
powder had risen to cover them from sight and a fighting-machine with
its legs contracted crumpled and abbreviated stood across the corner
of the pit and then amid the clangour of the machinery came a
drifting suspicion of human voices that i entertained at first only to
dismiss
i crouched watching this fighting-machine closely satisfying myself
now for the first time that the hood did indeed contain a martian as
the green flames lifted i could see the oily gleam of his integument
and the brightness of his eyes and suddenly i heard a yell and saw a
long tentacle reaching over the shoulder of the machine to the little
cage that hunched upon its back then something—something struggling
violently—was lifted high against the sky a black vague enigma
against the starlight; and as this black object came down again i saw
by the green brightness that it was a man for an instant he was
clearly visible he was a stout ruddy middle-aged man well dressed;
three days before he must have been walking the world a man of
considerable consequence i could see his staring eyes and gleams of
light on his studs and watch chain he vanished behind the mound and
for a moment there was silence and then began a shrieking and a
sustained and cheerful hooting from the martians
i slid down the rubbish struggled to my feet clapped my hands over my
ears and bolted into the scullery the curate who had been crouching
silently with his arms over his head looked up as i passed cried out
quite loudly at my desertion of him and came running after me
that night as we lurked in the scullery balanced between our horror
and the terrible fascination this peeping had although i felt an
urgent need of action i tried in vain to conceive some plan of escape;
but afterwards during the second day i was able to consider our
position with great clearness the curate i found was quite incapable
of discussion; this new and culminating atrocity had robbed him of all
vestiges of reason or forethought practically he had already sunk to
the level of an animal but as the saying goes i gripped myself with
both hands it grew upon my mind once i could face the facts that
terrible as our position was there was as yet no justification for
absolute despair our chief chance lay in the possibility of the
martians making the pit nothing more than a temporary encampment or
even if they kept it permanently they might not consider it necessary
to guard it and a chance of escape might be afforded us i also
weighed very carefully the possibility of our digging a way out in a
direction away from the pit but the chances of our emerging within
sight of some sentinel fighting-machine seemed at first too great and
i should have had to do all the digging myself the curate would
certainly have failed me
it was on the third day if my memory serves me right that i saw the
lad killed it was the only occasion on which i actually saw the
martians feed after that experience i avoided the hole in the wall for
the better part of a day i went into the scullery removed the door
and spent some hours digging with my hatchet as silently as possible;
but when i had made a hole about a couple of feet deep the loose earth
collapsed noisily and i did not dare continue i lost heart and lay
down on the scullery floor for a long time having no spirit even to
move and after that i abandoned altogether the idea of escaping by
excavation
it says much for the impression the martians had made upon me that at
first i entertained little or no hope of our escape being brought about
by their overthrow through any human effort but on the fourth or fifth
night i heard a sound like heavy guns
it was very late in the night and the moon was shining brightly the
martians had taken away the excavating-machine and save for a
fighting-machine that stood in the remoter bank of the pit and a
handling-machine that was buried out of my sight in a corner of the pit
immediately beneath my peephole the place was deserted by them except
for the pale glow from the handling-machine and the bars and patches of
white moonlight the pit was in darkness and except for the clinking
of the handling-machine quite still that night was a beautiful
serenity; save for one planet the moon seemed to have the sky to
herself i heard a dog howling and that familiar sound it was that
made me listen then i heard quite distinctly a booming exactly like
the sound of great guns six distinct reports i counted and after a
long interval six again and that was all
iv
the death of the curate
it was on the sixth day of our imprisonment that i peeped for the last
time and presently found myself alone instead of keeping close to me
and trying to oust me from the slit the curate had gone back into the
scullery i was struck by a sudden thought i went back quickly and
quietly into the scullery in the darkness i heard the curate drinking
i snatched in the darkness and my fingers caught a bottle of burgundy
for a few minutes there was a tussle the bottle struck the floor and
broke and i desisted and rose we stood panting and threatening each
other in the end i planted myself between him and the food and told
him of my determination to begin a discipline i divided the food in
the pantry into rations to last us ten days i would not let him eat
any more that day in the afternoon he made a feeble effort to get at
the food i had been dozing but in an instant i was awake all day and
all night we sat face to face i weary but resolute and he weeping and
complaining of his immediate hunger it was i know a night and a day
but to me it seemed—it seems now—an interminable length of time
and so our widened incompatibility ended at last in open conflict for
two vast days we struggled in undertones and wrestling contests there
were times when i beat and kicked him madly times when i cajoled and
persuaded him and once i tried to bribe him with the last bottle of
burgundy for there was a rain-water pump from which i could get water
but neither force nor kindness availed; he was indeed beyond reason he
would neither desist from his attacks on the food nor from his noisy
babbling to himself the rudimentary precautions to keep our
imprisonment endurable he would not observe slowly i began to realise
the complete overthrow of his intelligence to perceive that my sole
companion in this close and sickly darkness was a man insane
from certain vague memories i am inclined to think my own mind wandered
at times i had strange and hideous dreams whenever i slept it sounds
paradoxical but i am inclined to think that the weakness and insanity
of the curate warned me braced me and kept me a sane man
on the eighth day he began to talk aloud instead of whispering and
nothing i could do would moderate his speech
“it is just o god!” he would say over and over again “it is just on
me and mine be the punishment laid we have sinned we have fallen
short there was poverty sorrow; the poor were trodden in the dust
and i held my peace i preached acceptable folly—my god what
folly!—when i should have stood up though i died for it and called
upon them to repent—repent!    oppressors of the poor and needy  
 ! the wine press of god!”
then he would suddenly revert to the matter of the food i withheld from
him praying begging weeping at last threatening he began to raise
his voice—i prayed him not to he perceived a hold on me—he threatened
he would shout and bring the martians upon us for a time that scared
me; but any concession would have shortened our chance of escape beyond
estimating i defied him although i felt no assurance that he might
not do this thing but that day at any rate he did not he talked
with his voice rising slowly through the greater part of the eighth
and ninth days—threats entreaties mingled with a torrent of half-sane
and always frothy repentance for his vacant sham of god’s service such
as made me pity him then he slept awhile and began again with renewed
strength so loudly that i must needs make him desist
“be still!” i implored
he rose to his knees for he had been sitting in the darkness near the
copper
“i have been still too long” he said in a tone that must have reached
the pit “and now i must bear my witness woe unto this unfaithful
city! woe! woe! woe! woe! woe! to the inhabitants of the earth by
reason of the other voices of the trumpet——”
“shut up!” i said rising to my feet and in a terror lest the martians
should hear us “for god’s sake——”
“nay” shouted the curate at the top of his voice standing likewise
and extending his arms “speak! the word of the lord is upon me!”
in three strides he was at the door leading into the kitchen
“i must bear my witness! i go! it has already been too long delayed”
i put out my hand and felt the meat chopper hanging to the wall in a
flash i was after him i was fierce with fear before he was halfway
across the kitchen i had overtaken him with one last touch of humanity
i turned the blade back and struck him with the butt he went headlong
forward and lay stretched on the ground i stumbled over him and stood
panting he lay still
suddenly i heard a noise without the run and smash of slipping
plaster and the triangular aperture in the wall was darkened i looked
up and saw the lower surface of a handling-machine coming slowly across
the hole one of its gripping limbs curled amid the debris; another
limb appeared feeling its way over the fallen beams i stood
petrified staring then i saw through a sort of glass plate near the
edge of the body the face as we may call it and the large dark eyes
of a martian peering and then a long metallic snake of tentacle came
feeling slowly through the hole
i turned by an effort stumbled over the curate and stopped at the
scullery door the tentacle was now some way two yards or more in the
room and twisting and turning with queer sudden movements this way
and that for a while i stood fascinated by that slow fitful advance
then with a faint hoarse cry i forced myself across the scullery i
trembled violently; i could scarcely stand upright i opened the door
of the coal cellar and stood there in the darkness staring at the
faintly lit doorway into the kitchen and listening had the martian
seen me what was it doing now
something was moving to and fro there very quietly; every now and then
it tapped against the wall or started on its movements with a faint
metallic ringing like the movements of keys on a split-ring then a
heavy body—i knew too well what—was dragged across the floor of the
kitchen towards the opening irresistibly attracted i crept to the
door and peeped into the kitchen in the triangle of bright outer
sunlight i saw the martian in its briareus of a handling-machine
scrutinizing the curate’s head i thought at once that it would infer
my presence from the mark of the blow i had given him
i crept back to the coal cellar shut the door and began to cover
myself up as much as i could and as noiselessly as possible in the
darkness among the firewood and coal therein every now and then i
paused rigid to hear if the martian had thrust its tentacles through
the opening again
then the faint metallic jingle returned i traced it slowly feeling
over the kitchen presently i heard it nearer—in the scullery as i
judged i thought that its length might be insufficient to reach me i
prayed copiously it passed scraping faintly across the cellar door
an age of almost intolerable suspense intervened; then i heard it
fumbling at the latch! it had found the door! the martians understood
doors!
it worried at the catch for a minute perhaps and then the door
opened
in the darkness i could just see the thing—like an elephant’s trunk
more than anything else—waving towards me and touching and examining
the wall coals wood and ceiling it was like a black worm swaying its
blind head to and fro
once even it touched the heel of my boot i was on the verge of
screaming; i bit my hand for a time the tentacle was silent i could
have fancied it had been withdrawn presently with an abrupt click it
gripped something—i thought it had me!—and seemed to go out of the
cellar again for a minute i was not sure apparently it had taken a
lump of coal to examine
i seized the opportunity of slightly shifting my position which had
become cramped and then listened i whispered passionate prayers for
safety
then i heard the slow deliberate sound creeping towards me again
slowly slowly it drew near scratching against the walls and tapping
the furniture
while i was still doubtful it rapped smartly against the cellar door
and closed it i heard it go into the pantry and the biscuit-tins
rattled and a bottle smashed and then came a heavy bump against the
cellar door then silence that passed into an infinity of suspense
had it gone
at last i decided that it had
it came into the scullery no more; but i lay all the tenth day in the
close darkness buried among coals and firewood not daring even to
crawl out for the drink for which i craved it was the eleventh day
before i ventured so far from my security
v
the stillness
my first act before i went into the pantry was to fasten the door
between the kitchen and the scullery but the pantry was empty; every
scrap of food had gone apparently the martian had taken it all on the
previous day at that discovery i despaired for the first time i took
no food or no drink either on the eleventh or the twelfth day
at first my mouth and throat were parched and my strength ebbed
sensibly i sat about in the darkness of the scullery in a state of
despondent wretchedness my mind ran on eating i thought i had become
deaf for the noises of movement i had been accustomed to hear from the
pit had ceased absolutely i did not feel strong enough to crawl
noiselessly to the peephole or i would have gone there
on the twelfth day my throat was so painful that taking the chance of
alarming the martians i attacked the creaking rain-water pump that
stood by the sink and got a couple of glassfuls of blackened and
tainted rain water i was greatly refreshed by this and emboldened by
the fact that no enquiring tentacle followed the noise of my pumping
during these days in a rambling inconclusive way i thought much of
the curate and of the manner of his death
on the thirteenth day i drank some more water and dozed and thought
disjointedly of eating and of vague impossible plans of escape
whenever i dozed i dreamt of horrible phantasms of the death of the
curate or of sumptuous dinners; but asleep or awake i felt a keen
pain that urged me to drink again and again the light that came into
the scullery was no longer grey but red to my disordered imagination
it seemed the colour of blood
on the fourteenth day i went into the kitchen and i was surprised to
find that the fronds of the red weed had grown right across the hole in
the wall turning the half-light of the place into a crimson-coloured
obscurity
it was early on the fifteenth day that i heard a curious familiar
sequence of sounds in the kitchen and listening identified it as the
snuffing and scratching of a dog going into the kitchen i saw a dog’s
nose peering in through a break among the ruddy fronds this greatly
surprised me at the scent of me he barked shortly
i thought if i could induce him to come into the place quietly i should
be able perhaps to kill and eat him; and in any case it would be
advisable to kill him lest his actions attracted the attention of the
martians
i crept forward saying “good dog!” very softly; but he suddenly
withdrew his head and disappeared
i listened—i was not deaf—but certainly the pit was still i heard a
sound like the flutter of a bird’s wings and a hoarse croaking but
that was all
for a long while i lay close to the peephole but not daring to move
aside the red plants that obscured it once or twice i heard a faint
pitter-patter like the feet of the dog going hither and thither on the
sand far below me and there were more birdlike sounds but that was
all at length encouraged by the silence i looked out
except in the corner where a multitude of crows hopped and fought over
the skeletons of the dead the martians had consumed there was not a
living thing in the pit
i stared about me scarcely believing my eyes all the machinery had
gone save for the big mound of greyish-blue powder in one corner
certain bars of aluminium in another the black birds and the
skeletons of the killed the place was merely an empty circular pit in
the sand
slowly i thrust myself out through the red weed and stood upon the
mound of rubble i could see in any direction save behind me to the
north and neither martians nor sign of martians were to be seen the
pit dropped sheerly from my feet but a little way along the rubbish
afforded a practicable slope to the summit of the ruins my chance of
escape had come i began to tremble
i hesitated for some time and then in a gust of desperate resolution
and with a heart that throbbed violently i scrambled to the top of the
mound in which i had been buried so long
i looked about again to the northward too no martian was visible
when i had last seen this part of sheen in the daylight it had been a
straggling street of comfortable white and red houses interspersed
with abundant shady trees now i stood on a mound of smashed brickwork
clay and gravel over which spread a multitude of red cactus-shaped
plants knee-high without a solitary terrestrial growth to dispute
their footing the trees near me were dead and brown but further a
network of red thread scaled the still living stems
the neighbouring houses had all been wrecked but none had been burned;
their walls stood sometimes to the second story with smashed windows
and shattered doors the red weed grew tumultuously in their roofless
rooms below me was the great pit with the crows struggling for its
refuse a number of other birds hopped about among the ruins far away
i saw a gaunt cat slink crouchingly along a wall but traces of men
there were none
the day seemed by contrast with my recent confinement dazzlingly
bright the sky a glowing blue a gentle breeze kept the red weed that
covered every scrap of unoccupied ground gently swaying and oh! the
sweetness of the air!
vi
the work of fifteen days
for some time i stood tottering on the mound regardless of my safety
within that noisome den from which i had emerged i had thought with a
narrow intensity only of our immediate security i had not realised
what had been happening to the world had not anticipated this
startling vision of unfamiliar things i had expected to see sheen in
ruins—i found about me the landscape weird and lurid of another
planet
for that moment i touched an emotion beyond the common range of men
yet one that the poor brutes we dominate know only too well i felt as
a rabbit might feel returning to his burrow and suddenly confronted by
the work of a dozen busy navvies digging the foundations of a house i
felt the first inkling of a thing that presently grew quite clear in my
mind that oppressed me for many days a sense of dethronement a
persuasion that i was no longer a master but an animal among the
animals under the martian heel with us it would be as with them to
lurk and watch to run and hide; the fear and empire of man had passed
away
but so soon as this strangeness had been realised it passed and my
dominant motive became the hunger of my long and dismal fast in the
direction away from the pit i saw beyond a red-covered wall a patch
of garden ground unburied this gave me a hint and i went knee-deep
and sometimes neck-deep in the red weed the density of the weed gave
me a reassuring sense of hiding the wall was some six feet high and
when i attempted to clamber it i found i could not lift my feet to the
crest so i went along by the side of it and came to a corner and a
rockwork that enabled me to get to the top and tumble into the garden
i coveted here i found some young onions a couple of gladiolus bulbs
and a quantity of immature carrots all of which i secured and
scrambling over a ruined wall went on my way through scarlet and
crimson trees towards kew—it was like walking through an avenue of
gigantic blood drops—possessed with two ideas: to get more food and to
limp as soon and as far as my strength permitted out of this accursed
unearthly region of the pit
some way farther in a grassy place was a group of mushrooms which
also i devoured and then i came upon a brown sheet of flowing shallow
water where meadows used to be these fragments of nourishment served
only to whet my hunger at first i was surprised at this flood in a
hot dry summer but afterwards i discovered that it was caused by the
tropical exuberance of the red weed directly this extraordinary growth
encountered water it straightway became gigantic and of unparalleled
fecundity its seeds were simply poured down into the water of the wey
and thames and its swiftly growing and titanic water fronds speedily
choked both those rivers
at putney as i afterwards saw the bridge was almost lost in a tangle
of this weed and at richmond too the thames water poured in a broad
and shallow stream across the meadows of hampton and twickenham as the
water spread the weed followed them until the ruined villas of the
thames valley were for a time lost in this red swamp whose margin i
explored and much of the desolation the martians had caused was
concealed
in the end the red weed succumbed almost as quickly as it had spread a
cankering disease due it is believed to the action of certain
bacteria presently seized upon it now by the action of natural
selection all terrestrial plants have acquired a resisting power
against bacterial diseases—they never succumb without a severe
struggle but the red weed rotted like a thing already dead the fronds
became bleached and then shrivelled and brittle they broke off at the
least touch and the waters that had stimulated their early growth
carried their last vestiges out to sea
my first act on coming to this water was of course to slake my
thirst i drank a great deal of it and moved by an impulse gnawed
some fronds of red weed; but they were watery and had a sickly
metallic taste i found the water was sufficiently shallow for me to
wade securely although the red weed impeded my feet a little; but the
flood evidently got deeper towards the river and i turned back to
mortlake i managed to make out the road by means of occasional ruins
of its villas and fences and lamps and so presently i got out of this
spate and made my way to the hill going up towards roehampton and came
out on putney common
here the scenery changed from the strange and unfamiliar to the
wreckage of the familiar: patches of ground exhibited the devastation
of a cyclone and in a few score yards i would come upon perfectly
undisturbed spaces houses with their blinds trimly drawn and doors
closed as if they had been left for a day by the owners or as if
their inhabitants slept within the red weed was less abundant; the
tall trees along the lane were free from the red creeper i hunted for
food among the trees finding nothing and i also raided a couple of
silent houses but they had already been broken into and ransacked i
rested for the remainder of the daylight in a shrubbery being in my
enfeebled condition too fatigued to push on
all this time i saw no human beings and no signs of the martians i
encountered a couple of hungry-looking dogs but both hurried
circuitously away from the advances i made them near roehampton i had
seen two human skeletons—not bodies but skeletons picked clean—and in
the wood by me i found the crushed and scattered bones of several cats
and rabbits and the skull of a sheep but though i gnawed parts of
these in my mouth there was nothing to be got from them
after sunset i struggled on along the road towards putney where i
think the heat-ray must have been used for some reason and in the
garden beyond roehampton i got a quantity of immature potatoes
sufficient to stay my hunger from this garden one looked down upon
putney and the river the aspect of the place in the dusk was
singularly desolate: blackened trees blackened desolate ruins and
down the hill the sheets of the flooded river red-tinged with the
weed and over all—silence it filled me with indescribable terror to
think how swiftly that desolating change had come
for a time i believed that mankind had been swept out of existence and
that i stood there alone the last man left alive hard by the top of
putney hill i came upon another skeleton with the arms dislocated and
removed several yards from the rest of the body as i proceeded i
became more and more convinced that the extermination of mankind was
save for such stragglers as myself already accomplished in this part
of the world the martians i thought had gone on and left the country
desolated seeking food elsewhere perhaps even now they were
destroying berlin or paris or it might be they had gone northward
vii
the man on putney hill
i spent that night in the inn that stands at the top of putney hill
sleeping in a made bed for the first time since my flight to
leatherhead i will not tell the needless trouble i had breaking into
that house—afterwards i found the front door was on the latch—nor how i
ransacked every room for food until just on the verge of despair in
what seemed to me to be a servant’s bedroom i found a rat-gnawed crust
and two tins of pineapple the place had been already searched and
emptied in the bar i afterwards found some biscuits and sandwiches
that had been overlooked the latter i could not eat they were too
rotten but the former not only stayed my hunger but filled my
pockets i lit no lamps fearing some martian might come beating that
part of london for food in the night before i went to bed i had an
interval of restlessness and prowled from window to window peering
out for some sign of these monsters i slept little as i lay in bed i
found myself thinking consecutively—a thing i do not remember to have
done since my last argument with the curate during all the intervening
time my mental condition had been a hurrying succession of vague
emotional states or a sort of stupid receptivity but in the night my
brain reinforced i suppose by the food i had eaten grew clear
again and i thought
three things struggled for possession of my mind: the killing of the
curate the whereabouts of the martians and the possible fate of my
wife the former gave me no sensation of horror or remorse to recall; i
saw it simply as a thing done a memory infinitely disagreeable but
quite without the quality of remorse i saw myself then as i see myself
now driven step by step towards that hasty blow the creature of a
sequence of accidents leading inevitably to that i felt no
condemnation; yet the memory static unprogressive haunted me in the
silence of the night with that sense of the nearness of god that
sometimes comes into the stillness and the darkness i stood my trial
my only trial for that moment of wrath and fear i retraced every step
of our conversation from the moment when i had found him crouching
beside me heedless of my thirst and pointing to the fire and smoke
that streamed up from the ruins of weybridge we had been incapable of
co-operation—grim chance had taken no heed of that had i foreseen i
should have left him at halliford but i did not foresee; and crime is
to foresee and do and i set this down as i have set all this story
down as it was there were no witnesses—all these things i might have
concealed but i set it down and the reader must form his judgment as
he will
and when by an effort i had set aside that picture of a prostrate
body i faced the problem of the martians and the fate of my wife for
the former i had no data; i could imagine a hundred things and so
unhappily i could for the latter and suddenly that night became
terrible i found myself sitting up in bed staring at the dark i
found myself praying that the heat-ray might have suddenly and
painlessly struck her out of being since the night of my return from
leatherhead i had not prayed i had uttered prayers fetish prayers
had prayed as heathens mutter charms when i was in extremity; but now i
prayed indeed pleading steadfastly and sanely face to face with the
darkness of god strange night! strangest in this that so soon as dawn
had come i who had talked with god crept out of the house like a rat
leaving its hiding place—a creature scarcely larger an inferior
animal a thing that for any passing whim of our masters might be
hunted and killed perhaps they also prayed confidently to god surely
if we have learned nothing else this war has taught us pity—pity for
those witless souls that suffer our dominion
the morning was bright and fine and the eastern sky glowed pink and
was fretted with little golden clouds in the road that runs from the
top of putney hill to wimbledon was a number of poor vestiges of the
panic torrent that must have poured londonward on the sunday night
after the fighting began there was a little two-wheeled cart inscribed
with the name of thomas lobb greengrocer new malden with a smashed
wheel and an abandoned tin trunk; there was a straw hat trampled into
the now hardened mud and at the top of west hill a lot of
blood-stained glass about the overturned water trough my movements
were languid my plans of the vaguest i had an idea of going to
leatherhead though i knew that there i had the poorest chance of
finding my wife certainly unless death had overtaken them suddenly
my cousins and she would have fled thence; but it seemed to me i might
find or learn there whither the surrey people had fled i knew i wanted
to find my wife that my heart ached for her and the world of men but
i had no clear idea how the finding might be done i was also sharply
aware now of my intense loneliness from the corner i went under cover
of a thicket of trees and bushes to the edge of wimbledon common
stretching wide and far
that dark expanse was lit in patches by yellow gorse and broom; there
was no red weed to be seen and as i prowled hesitating on the verge
of the open the sun rose flooding it all with light and vitality i
came upon a busy swarm of little frogs in a swampy place among the
trees i stopped to look at them drawing a lesson from their stout
resolve to live and presently turning suddenly with an odd feeling
of being watched i beheld something crouching amid a clump of bushes
i stood regarding this i made a step towards it and it rose up and
became a man armed with a cutlass i approached him slowly he stood
silent and motionless regarding me
as i drew nearer i perceived he was dressed in clothes as dusty and
filthy as my own; he looked indeed as though he had been dragged
through a culvert nearer i distinguished the green slime of ditches
mixing with the pale drab of dried clay and shiny coaly patches his
black hair fell over his eyes and his face was dark and dirty and
sunken so that at first i did not recognise him there was a red cut
across the lower part of his face
“stop!” he cried when i was within ten yards of him and i stopped
his voice was hoarse “where do you come from” he said
i thought surveying him
“i come from mortlake” i said “i was buried near the pit the martians
made about their cylinder i have worked my way out and escaped”
“there is no food about here” he said “this is my country all this
hill down to the river and back to clapham and up to the edge of the
common there is only food for one which way are you going”
i answered slowly
“i don’t know” i said “i have been buried in the ruins of a house
thirteen or fourteen days i don’t know what has happened”
he looked at me doubtfully then started and looked with a changed
expression
“i’ve no wish to stop about here” said i “i think i shall go to
leatherhead for my wife was there”
he shot out a pointing finger
“it is you” said he; “the man from woking and you weren’t killed at
weybridge”
i recognised him at the same moment
“you are the artilleryman who came into my garden”
“good luck!” he said “we are lucky ones! fancy _you_!” he put out a
hand and i took it “i crawled up a drain” he said “but they didn’t
kill everyone and after they went away i got off towards walton across
the fields but—— it’s not sixteen days altogether—and your hair is
grey” he looked over his shoulder suddenly “only a rook” he said
“one gets to know that birds have shadows these days this is a bit
open let us crawl under those bushes and talk”
“have you seen any martians” i said “since i crawled out——”
“they’ve gone away across london” he said “i guess they’ve got a
bigger camp there of a night all over there hampstead way the sky
is alive with their lights it’s like a great city and in the glare
you can just see them moving by daylight you can’t but nearer—i
haven’t seen them—” (he counted on his fingers) “five days then i saw
a couple across hammersmith way carrying something big and the night
before last”—he stopped and spoke impressively—“it was just a matter of
lights but it was something up in the air i believe they’ve built a
flying-machine and are learning to fly”
i stopped on hands and knees for we had come to the bushes
“fly!”
“yes” he said “fly”
i went on into a little bower and sat down
“it is all over with humanity” i said “if they can do that they will
simply go round the world”
he nodded
“they will but—— it will relieve things over here a bit and
besides——” he looked at me “aren’t you satisfied it _is_ up with
humanity i am we’re down; we’re beat”
i stared strange as it may seem i had not arrived at this fact—a fact
perfectly obvious so soon as he spoke i had still held a vague hope;
rather i had kept a lifelong habit of mind he repeated his words
“we’re beat” they carried absolute conviction
“it’s all over” he said “they’ve lost _one_—just _one_ and they’ve
made their footing good and crippled the greatest power in the world
they’ve walked over us the death of that one at weybridge was an
accident and these are only pioneers they kept on coming these green
stars—i’ve seen none these five or six days but i’ve no doubt they’re
falling somewhere every night nothing’s to be done we’re under! we’re
beat!”
i made him no answer i sat staring before me trying in vain to devise
some countervailing thought
“this isn’t a war” said the artilleryman “it never was a war any
more than there’s war between man and ants”
suddenly i recalled the night in the observatory
“after the tenth shot they fired no more—at least until the first
cylinder came”
“how do you know” said the artilleryman i explained he thought
“something wrong with the gun” he said “but what if there is they’ll
get it right again and even if there’s a delay how can it alter the
end it’s just men and ants there’s the ants builds their cities live
their lives have wars revolutions until the men want them out of the
way and then they go out of the way that’s what we are now—just ants
only——”
“yes” i said
“we’re eatable ants”
we sat looking at each other
“and what will they do with us” i said
“that’s what i’ve been thinking” he said; “that’s what i’ve been
thinking after weybridge i went south—thinking i saw what was up
most of the people were hard at it squealing and exciting themselves
but i’m not so fond of squealing i’ve been in sight of death once or
twice; i’m not an ornamental soldier and at the best and worst
death—it’s just death and it’s the man that keeps on thinking comes
through i saw everyone tracking away south says i ‘food won’t last
this way’ and i turned right back i went for the martians like a
sparrow goes for man all round”—he waved a hand to the
horizon—“they’re starving in heaps bolting treading on each other 
he saw my face and halted awkwardly
“no doubt lots who had money have gone away to france” he said he
seemed to hesitate whether to apologise met my eyes and went on:
“there’s food all about here canned things in shops; wines spirits
mineral waters; and the water mains and drains are empty well i was
telling you what i was thinking ‘here’s intelligent things’ i said
‘and it seems they want us for food first they’ll smash us up—ships
machines guns cities all the order and organisation all that will
go if we were the size of ants we might pull through but we’re not
it’s all too bulky to stop that’s the first certainty’ eh”
i assented
“it is; i’ve thought it out very well then—next; at present we’re
caught as we’re wanted a martian has only to go a few miles to get a
crowd on the run and i saw one one day out by wandsworth picking
houses to pieces and routing among the wreckage but they won’t keep on
doing that so soon as they’ve settled all our guns and ships and
smashed our railways and done all the things they are doing over
there they will begin catching us systematic picking the best and
storing us in cages and things that’s what they will start doing in a
bit lord! they haven’t begun on us yet don’t you see that”
“not begun!” i exclaimed
“not begun all that’s happened so far is through our not having the
sense to keep quiet—worrying them with guns and such foolery and
losing our heads and rushing off in crowds to where there wasn’t any
more safety than where we were they don’t want to bother us yet
they’re making their things—making all the things they couldn’t bring
with them getting things ready for the rest of their people very
likely that’s why the cylinders have stopped for a bit for fear of
hitting those who are here and instead of our rushing about blind on
the howl or getting dynamite on the chance of busting them up we’ve
got to fix ourselves up according to the new state of affairs that’s
how i figure it out it isn’t quite according to what a man wants for
his species but it’s about what the facts point to and that’s the
principle i acted upon cities nations civilisation progress—it’s
all over that game’s up we’re beat”
“but if that is so what is there to live for”
the artilleryman looked at me for a moment
“there won’t be any more blessed concerts for a million years or so;
there won’t be any royal academy of arts and no nice little feeds at
restaurants if it’s amusement you’re after i reckon the game is up
if you’ve got any drawing-room manners or a dislike to eating peas with
a knife or dropping aitches you’d better chuck ’em away they ain’t no
further use”
“you mean——”
“i mean that men like me are going on living—for the sake of the breed
i tell you i’m grim set on living and if i’m not mistaken you’ll
show what insides _you’ve_ got too before long we aren’t going to be
exterminated and i don’t mean to be caught either and tamed and
fattened and bred like a thundering ox ugh! fancy those brown
creepers!”
“you don’t mean to say——”
“i do i’m going on under their feet i’ve got it planned; i’ve
thought it out we men are beat we don’t know enough we’ve got to
learn before we’ve got a chance and we’ve got to live and keep
independent while we learn see! that’s what has to be done”
i stared astonished and stirred profoundly by the man’s resolution
“great god!” cried i “but you are a man indeed!” and suddenly i
gripped his hand
“eh!” he said with his eyes shining “i’ve thought it out eh”
“go on” i said
“well those who mean to escape their catching must get ready i’m
getting ready mind you it isn’t all of us that are made for wild
beasts; and that’s what it’s got to be that’s why i watched you i had
my doubts you’re slender i didn’t know that it was you you see or
just how you’d been buried all these—the sort of people that lived in
these houses and all those damn little clerks that used to live down
_that_ way—they’d be no good they haven’t any spirit in them—no proud
dreams and no proud lusts; and a man who hasn’t one or the other—lord!
what is he but funk and precautions they just used to skedaddle off to
work—i’ve seen hundreds of ’em bit of breakfast in hand running wild
and shining to catch their little season-ticket train for fear they’d
get dismissed if they didn’t; working at businesses they were afraid to
take the trouble to understand; skedaddling back for fear they wouldn’t
be in time for dinner; keeping indoors after dinner for fear of the
back streets and sleeping with the wives they married not because
they wanted them but because they had a bit of money that would make
for safety in their one little miserable skedaddle through the world
lives insured and a bit invested for fear of accidents and on
sundays—fear of the hereafter as if hell was built for rabbits! well
the martians will just be a godsend to these nice roomy cages
fattening food careful breeding no worry after a week or so chasing
about the fields and lands on empty stomachs they’ll come and be
caught cheerful they’ll be quite glad after a bit they’ll wonder what
people did before there were martians to take care of them and the bar
loafers and mashers and singers—i can imagine them i can imagine
them” he said with a sort of sombre gratification “there’ll be any
amount of sentiment and religion loose among them there’s hundreds of
things i saw with my eyes that i’ve only begun to see clearly these
last few days there’s lots will take things as they are—fat and
stupid; and lots will be worried by a sort of feeling that it’s all
wrong and that they ought to be doing something now whenever things
are so that a lot of people feel they ought to be doing something the
weak and those who go weak with a lot of complicated thinking always
make for a sort of do-nothing religion very pious and superior and
submit to persecution and the will of the lord very likely you’ve seen
the same thing it’s energy in a gale of funk and turned clean inside
out these cages will be full of psalms and hymns and piety and those
of a less simple sort will work in a bit of—what is it—eroticism”
he paused
“very likely these martians will make pets of some of them; train them
to do tricks—who knows—get sentimental over the pet boy who grew up
and had to be killed and some maybe they will train to hunt us”
“no” i cried “that’s impossible! no human being——”
“what’s the good of going on with such lies” said the artilleryman
“there’s men who’d do it cheerful what nonsense to pretend there
isn’t!”
and i succumbed to his conviction
“if they come after me” he said; “lord if they come after me!” and
subsided into a grim meditation
i sat contemplating these things i could find nothing to bring against
this man’s reasoning in the days before the invasion no one would have
questioned my intellectual superiority to his—i a professed and
recognised writer on philosophical themes and he a common soldier;
and yet he had already formulated a situation that i had scarcely
realised
“what are you doing” i said presently “what plans have you made”
he hesitated
“well it’s like this” he said “what have we to do we have to invent
a sort of life where men can live and breed and be sufficiently secure
to bring the children up yes—wait a bit and i’ll make it clearer what
i think ought to be done the tame ones will go like all tame beasts;
in a few generations they’ll be big beautiful rich-blooded
stupid—rubbish! the risk is that we who keep wild will go
savage—degenerate into a sort of big savage rat    you see how i
mean to live is underground i’ve been thinking about the drains of
course those who don’t know drains think horrible things; but under
this london are miles and miles—hundreds of miles—and a few days rain
and london empty will leave them sweet and clean the main drains are
big enough and airy enough for anyone then there’s cellars vaults
stores from which bolting passages may be made to the drains and the
railway tunnels and subways eh you begin to see and we form a
band—able-bodied clean-minded men we’re not going to pick up any
rubbish that drifts in weaklings go out again”
“as you meant me to go”
“well—i parleyed didn’t i”
“we won’t quarrel about that go on”
“those who stop obey orders able-bodied clean-minded women we want
also—mothers and teachers no lackadaisical ladies—no blasted rolling
eyes we can’t have any weak or silly life is real again and the
useless and cumbersome and mischievous have to die they ought to die
they ought to be willing to die it’s a sort of disloyalty after all
to live and taint the race and they can’t be happy moreover dying’s
none so dreadful; it’s the funking makes it bad and in all those
places we shall gather our district will be london and we may even be
able to keep a watch and run about in the open when the martians keep
away play cricket perhaps that’s how we shall save the race eh
it’s a possible thing but saving the race is nothing in itself as i
say that’s only being rats it’s saving our knowledge and adding to it
is the thing there men like you come in there’s books there’s
models we must make great safe places down deep and get all the books
we can; not novels and poetry swipes but ideas science books that’s
where men like you come in we must go to the british museum and pick
all those books through especially we must keep up our science—learn
more we must watch these martians some of us must go as spies when
it’s all working perhaps i will get caught i mean and the great
thing is we must leave the martians alone we mustn’t even steal if
we get in their way we clear out we must show them we mean no harm
yes i know but they’re intelligent things and they won’t hunt us
down if they have all they want and think we’re just harmless vermin”
the artilleryman paused and laid a brown hand upon my arm
“after all it may not be so much we may have to learn before—just
imagine this: four or five of their fighting machines suddenly starting
off—heat-rays right and left and not a martian in ’em not a martian
in ’em but men—men who have learned the way how it may be in my time
even—those men fancy having one of them lovely things with its
heat-ray wide and free! fancy having it in control! what would it
matter if you smashed to smithereens at the end of the run after a
bust like that i reckon the martians’ll open their beautiful eyes!
can’t you see them man can’t you see them hurrying hurrying—puffing
and blowing and hooting to their other mechanical affairs something
out of gear in every case and swish bang rattle swish! just as they
are fumbling over it _swish_ comes the heat-ray and behold! man has
come back to his own”
for a while the imaginative daring of the artilleryman and the tone of
assurance and courage he assumed completely dominated my mind i
believed unhesitatingly both in his forecast of human destiny and in
the practicability of his astonishing scheme and the reader who thinks
me susceptible and foolish must contrast his position reading steadily
with all his thoughts about his subject and mine crouching fearfully
in the bushes and listening distracted by apprehension we talked in
this manner through the early morning time and later crept out of the
bushes and after scanning the sky for martians hurried precipitately
to the house on putney hill where he had made his lair it was the coal
cellar of the place and when i saw the work he had spent a week
upon—it was a burrow scarcely ten yards long which he designed to
reach to the main drain on putney hill—i had my first inkling of the
gulf between his dreams and his powers such a hole i could have dug in
a day but i believed in him sufficiently to work with him all that
morning until past midday at his digging we had a garden barrow and
shot the earth we removed against the kitchen range we refreshed
ourselves with a tin of mock-turtle soup and wine from the neighbouring
pantry i found a curious relief from the aching strangeness of the
world in this steady labour as we worked i turned his project over in
my mind and presently objections and doubts began to arise; but i
worked there all the morning so glad was i to find myself with a
purpose again after working an hour i began to speculate on the
distance one had to go before the cloaca was reached the chances we
had of missing it altogether my immediate trouble was why we should
dig this long tunnel when it was possible to get into the drain at
once down one of the manholes and work back to the house it seemed to
me too that the house was inconveniently chosen and required a
needless length of tunnel and just as i was beginning to face these
things the artilleryman stopped digging and looked at me
“we’re working well” he said he put down his spade “let us knock off
a bit” he said “i think it’s time we reconnoitred from the roof of the
house”
i was for going on and after a little hesitation he resumed his spade;
and then suddenly i was struck by a thought i stopped and so did he
at once
“why were you walking about the common” i said “instead of being
here”
“taking the air” he said “i was coming back it’s safer by night”
“but the work”
“oh one can’t always work” he said and in a flash i saw the man
plain he hesitated holding his spade “we ought to reconnoitre now”
he said “because if any come near they may hear the spades and drop
upon us unawares”
i was no longer disposed to object we went together to the roof and
stood on a ladder peeping out of the roof door no martians were to be
seen and we ventured out on the tiles and slipped down under shelter
of the parapet
from this position a shrubbery hid the greater portion of putney but
we could see the river below a bubbly mass of red weed and the low
parts of lambeth flooded and red the red creeper swarmed up the trees
about the old palace and their branches stretched gaunt and dead and
set with shrivelled leaves from amid its clusters it was strange how
entirely dependent both these things were upon flowing water for their
propagation about us neither had gained a footing; laburnums pink
mays snowballs and trees of arbor-vitae rose out of laurels and
hydrangeas green and brilliant into the sunlight beyond kensington
dense smoke was rising and that and a blue haze hid the northward
hills
the artilleryman began to tell me of the sort of people who still
remained in london
“one night last week” he said “some fools got the electric light in
order and there was all regent street and the circus ablaze crowded
with painted and ragged drunkards men and women dancing and shouting
till dawn a man who was there told me and as the day came they became
aware of a fighting-machine standing near by the langham and looking
down at them heaven knows how long he had been there it must have
given some of them a nasty turn he came down the road towards them
and picked up nearly a hundred too drunk or frightened to run away”
grotesque gleam of a time no history will ever fully describe!
from that in answer to my questions he came round to his grandiose
plans again he grew enthusiastic he talked so eloquently of the
possibility of capturing a fighting-machine that i more than half
believed in him again but now that i was beginning to understand
something of his quality i could divine the stress he laid on doing
nothing precipitately and i noted that now there was no question that
he personally was to capture and fight the great machine
after a time we went down to the cellar neither of us seemed disposed
to resume digging and when he suggested a meal i was nothing loath
he became suddenly very generous and when we had eaten he went away
and returned with some excellent cigars we lit these and his optimism
glowed he was inclined to regard my coming as a great occasion
“there’s some champagne in the cellar” he said
“we can dig better on this thames-side burgundy” said i
“no” said he; “i am host today champagne! great god! we’ve a heavy
enough task before us! let us take a rest and gather strength while we
may look at these blistered hands!”
and pursuant to this idea of a holiday he insisted upon playing cards
after we had eaten he taught me euchre and after dividing london
between us i taking the northern side and he the southern we played
for parish points grotesque and foolish as this will seem to the sober
reader it is absolutely true and what is more remarkable i found the
card game and several others we played extremely interesting
strange mind of man! that with our species upon the edge of
extermination or appalling degradation with no clear prospect before
us but the chance of a horrible death we could sit following the
chance of this painted pasteboard and playing the “joker” with vivid
delight afterwards he taught me poker and i beat him at three tough
chess games when dark came we decided to take the risk and lit a
lamp
after an interminable string of games we supped and the artilleryman
finished the champagne we went on smoking the cigars he was no longer
the energetic regenerator of his species i had encountered in the
morning he was still optimistic but it was a less kinetic a more
thoughtful optimism i remember he wound up with my health proposed in
a speech of small variety and considerable intermittence i took a
cigar and went upstairs to look at the lights of which he had spoken
that blazed so greenly along the highgate hills
at first i stared unintelligently across the london valley the
northern hills were shrouded in darkness; the fires near kensington
glowed redly and now and then an orange-red tongue of flame flashed up
and vanished in the deep blue night all the rest of london was black
then nearer i perceived a strange light a pale violet-purple
fluorescent glow quivering under the night breeze for a space i could
not understand it and then i knew that it must be the red weed from
which this faint irradiation proceeded with that realisation my
dormant sense of wonder my sense of the proportion of things awoke
again i glanced from that to mars red and clear glowing high in the
west and then gazed long and earnestly at the darkness of hampstead
and highgate
i remained a very long time upon the roof wondering at the grotesque
changes of the day i recalled my mental states from the midnight
prayer to the foolish card-playing i had a violent revulsion of
feeling i remember i flung away the cigar with a certain wasteful
symbolism my folly came to me with glaring exaggeration i seemed a
traitor to my wife and to my kind; i was filled with remorse i
resolved to leave this strange undisciplined dreamer of great things to
his drink and gluttony and to go on into london there it seemed to
me i had the best chance of learning what the martians and my
fellowmen were doing i was still upon the roof when the late moon
rose
viii
dead london
after i had parted from the artilleryman i went down the hill and by
the high street across the bridge to fulham the red weed was
tumultuous at that time and nearly choked the bridge roadway; but its
fronds were already whitened in patches by the spreading disease that
presently removed it so swiftly
at the corner of the lane that runs to putney bridge station i found a
man lying he was as black as a sweep with the black dust alive but
helplessly and speechlessly drunk i could get nothing from him but
curses and furious lunges at my head i think i should have stayed by
him but for the brutal expression of his face
there was black dust along the roadway from the bridge onwards and it
grew thicker in fulham the streets were horribly quiet i got
food—sour hard and mouldy but quite eatable—in a baker’s shop here
some way towards walham green the streets became clear of powder and i
passed a white terrace of houses on fire; the noise of the burning was
an absolute relief going on towards brompton the streets were quiet
again
here i came once more upon the black powder in the streets and upon
dead bodies i saw altogether about a dozen in the length of the fulham
road they had been dead many days so that i hurried quickly past
them the black powder covered them over and softened their outlines
one or two had been disturbed by dogs
where there was no black powder it was curiously like a sunday in the
city with the closed shops the houses locked up and the blinds drawn
the desertion and the stillness in some places plunderers had been at
work but rarely at other than the provision and wine shops a
jeweller’s window had been broken open in one place but apparently the
thief had been disturbed and a number of gold chains and a watch lay
scattered on the pavement i did not trouble to touch them farther on
was a tattered woman in a heap on a doorstep; the hand that hung over
her knee was gashed and bled down her rusty brown dress and a smashed
magnum of champagne formed a pool across the pavement she seemed
asleep but she was dead
the farther i penetrated into london the profounder grew the
stillness but it was not so much the stillness of death—it was the
stillness of suspense of expectation at any time the destruction that
had already singed the northwestern borders of the metropolis and had
annihilated ealing and kilburn might strike among these houses and
leave them smoking ruins it was a city condemned and derelict   
in south kensington the streets were clear of dead and of black powder
it was near south kensington that i first heard the howling it crept
almost imperceptibly upon my senses it was a sobbing alternation of
two notes “ulla ulla ulla ulla” keeping on perpetually when i
passed streets that ran northward it grew in volume and houses and
buildings seemed to deaden and cut it off again it came in a full tide
down exhibition road i stopped staring towards kensington gardens
wondering at this strange remote wailing it was as if that mighty
desert of houses had found a voice for its fear and solitude
“ulla ulla ulla ulla” wailed that superhuman note—great waves of
sound sweeping down the broad sunlit roadway between the tall
buildings on each side i turned northwards marvelling towards the
iron gates of hyde park i had half a mind to break into the natural
history museum and find my way up to the summits of the towers in
order to see across the park but i decided to keep to the ground
where quick hiding was possible and so went on up the exhibition road
all the large mansions on each side of the road were empty and still
and my footsteps echoed against the sides of the houses at the top
near the park gate i came upon a strange sight—a bus overturned and
the skeleton of a horse picked clean i puzzled over this for a time
and then went on to the bridge over the serpentine the voice grew
stronger and stronger though i could see nothing above the housetops
on the north side of the park save a haze of smoke to the northwest
“ulla ulla ulla ulla” cried the voice coming as it seemed to me
from the district about regent’s park the desolating cry worked upon
my mind the mood that had sustained me passed the wailing took
possession of me i found i was intensely weary footsore and now
again hungry and thirsty
it was already past noon why was i wandering alone in this city of the
dead why was i alone when all london was lying in state and in its
black shroud i felt intolerably lonely my mind ran on old friends
that i had forgotten for years i thought of the poisons in the
chemists’ shops of the liquors the wine merchants stored; i recalled
the two sodden creatures of despair who so far as i knew shared the
city with myself   
i came into oxford street by the marble arch and here again were black
powder and several bodies and an evil ominous smell from the gratings
of the cellars of some of the houses i grew very thirsty after the
heat of my long walk with infinite trouble i managed to break into a
public-house and get food and drink i was weary after eating and went
into the parlour behind the bar and slept on a black horsehair sofa i
found there
i awoke to find that dismal howling still in my ears “ulla ulla
ulla ulla” it was now dusk and after i had routed out some biscuits
and a cheese in the bar—there was a meat safe but it contained nothing
but maggots—i wandered on through the silent residential squares to
baker street—portman square is the only one i can name—and so came out
at last upon regent’s park and as i emerged from the top of baker
street i saw far away over the trees in the clearness of the sunset
the hood of the martian giant from which this howling proceeded i was
not terrified i came upon him as if it were a matter of course i
watched him for some time but he did not move he appeared to be
standing and yelling for no reason that i could discover
i tried to formulate a plan of action that perpetual sound of “ulla
ulla ulla ulla” confused my mind perhaps i was too tired to be very
fearful certainly i was more curious to know the reason of this
monotonous crying than afraid i turned back away from the park and
struck into park road intending to skirt the park went along under
the shelter of the terraces and got a view of this stationary howling
martian from the direction of st john’s wood a couple of hundred
yards out of baker street i heard a yelping chorus and saw first a
dog with a piece of putrescent red meat in his jaws coming headlong
towards me and then a pack of starving mongrels in pursuit of him he
made a wide curve to avoid me as though he feared i might prove a
fresh competitor as the yelping died away down the silent road the
wailing sound of “ulla ulla ulla ulla” reasserted itself
i came upon the wrecked handling-machine halfway to st john’s wood
station at first i thought a house had fallen across the road it was
only as i clambered among the ruins that i saw with a start this
mechanical samson lying with its tentacles bent and smashed and
twisted among the ruins it had made the forepart was shattered it
seemed as if it had driven blindly straight at the house and had been
overwhelmed in its overthrow it seemed to me then that this might have
happened by a handling-machine escaping from the guidance of its
martian i could not clamber among the ruins to see it and the
twilight was now so far advanced that the blood with which its seat was
smeared and the gnawed gristle of the martian that the dogs had left
were invisible to me
wondering still more at all that i had seen i pushed on towards
primrose hill far away through a gap in the trees i saw a second
martian as motionless as the first standing in the park towards the
zoological gardens and silent a little beyond the ruins about the
smashed handling-machine i came upon the red weed again and found the
regent’s canal a spongy mass of dark-red vegetation
as i crossed the bridge the sound of “ulla ulla ulla ulla” ceased
it was as it were cut off the silence came like a thunderclap
the dusky houses about me stood faint and tall and dim; the trees
towards the park were growing black all about me the red weed
clambered among the ruins writhing to get above me in the dimness
night the mother of fear and mystery was coming upon me but while
that voice sounded the solitude the desolation had been endurable; by
virtue of it london had still seemed alive and the sense of life about
me had upheld me then suddenly a change the passing of something—i
knew not what—and then a stillness that could be felt nothing but this
gaunt quiet
london about me gazed at me spectrally the windows in the white houses
were like the eye sockets of skulls about me my imagination found a
thousand noiseless enemies moving terror seized me a horror of my
temerity in front of me the road became pitchy black as though it was
tarred and i saw a contorted shape lying across the pathway i could
not bring myself to go on i turned down st john’s wood road and ran
headlong from this unendurable stillness towards kilburn i hid from
the night and the silence until long after midnight in a cabmen’s
shelter in harrow road but before the dawn my courage returned and
while the stars were still in the sky i turned once more towards
regent’s park i missed my way among the streets and presently saw
down a long avenue in the half-light of the early dawn the curve of
primrose hill on the summit towering up to the fading stars was a
third martian erect and motionless like the others
an insane resolve possessed me i would die and end it and i would
save myself even the trouble of killing myself i marched on recklessly
towards this titan and then as i drew nearer and the light grew i
saw that a multitude of black birds was circling and clustering about
the hood at that my heart gave a bound and i began running along the
road
i hurried through the red weed that choked st edmund’s terrace (i
waded breast-high across a torrent of water that was rushing down from
the waterworks towards the albert road) and emerged upon the grass
before the rising of the sun great mounds had been heaped about the
crest of the hill making a huge redoubt of it—it was the final and
largest place the martians had made—and from behind these heaps there
rose a thin smoke against the sky against the sky line an eager dog
ran and disappeared the thought that had flashed into my mind grew
real grew credible i felt no fear only a wild trembling exultation
as i ran up the hill towards the motionless monster out of the hood
hung lank shreds of brown at which the hungry birds pecked and tore
in another moment i had scrambled up the earthen rampart and stood upon
its crest and the interior of the redoubt was below me a mighty space
it was with gigantic machines here and there within it huge mounds of
material and strange shelter places and scattered about it some in
their overturned war-machines some in the now rigid handling-machines
and a dozen of them stark and silent and laid in a row were the
martians—_dead_!—slain by the putrefactive and disease bacteria against
which their systems were unprepared; slain as the red weed was being
slain; slain after all man’s devices had failed by the humblest
things that god in his wisdom has put upon this earth
for so it had come about as indeed i and many men might have foreseen
had not terror and disaster blinded our minds these germs of disease
have taken toll of humanity since the beginning of things—taken toll of
our prehuman ancestors since life began here but by virtue of this
natural selection of our kind we have developed resisting power; to no
germs do we succumb without a struggle and to many—those that cause
putrefaction in dead matter for instance—our living frames are
altogether immune but there are no bacteria in mars and directly
these invaders arrived directly they drank and fed our microscopic
allies began to work their overthrow already when i watched them they
were irrevocably doomed dying and rotting even as they went to and
fro it was inevitable by the toll of a billion deaths man has bought
his birthright of the earth and it is his against all comers; it would
still be his were the martians ten times as mighty as they are for
neither do men live nor die in vain
here and there they were scattered nearly fifty altogether in that
great gulf they had made overtaken by a death that must have seemed to
them as incomprehensible as any death could be to me also at that time
this death was incomprehensible all i knew was that these things that
had been alive and so terrible to men were dead for a moment i
believed that the destruction of sennacherib had been repeated that
god had repented that the angel of death had slain them in the night
i stood staring into the pit and my heart lightened gloriously even
as the rising sun struck the world to fire about me with his rays the
pit was still in darkness; the mighty engines so great and wonderful
in their power and complexity so unearthly in their tortuous forms
rose weird and vague and strange out of the shadows towards the light
a multitude of dogs i could hear fought over the bodies that lay
darkly in the depth of the pit far below me across the pit on its
farther lip flat and vast and strange lay the great flying-machine
with which they had been experimenting upon our denser atmosphere when
decay and death arrested them death had come not a day too soon at
the sound of a cawing overhead i looked up at the huge fighting-machine
that would fight no more for ever at the tattered red shreds of flesh
that dripped down upon the overturned seats on the summit of primrose
hill
i turned and looked down the slope of the hill to where enhaloed now
in birds stood those other two martians that i had seen overnight
just as death had overtaken them the one had died even as it had been
crying to its companions; perhaps it was the last to die and its voice
had gone on perpetually until the force of its machinery was exhausted
they glittered now harmless tripod towers of shining metal in the
brightness of the rising sun
all about the pit and saved as by a miracle from everlasting
destruction stretched the great mother of cities those who have only
seen london veiled in her sombre robes of smoke can scarcely imagine
the naked clearness and beauty of the silent wilderness of houses
eastward over the blackened ruins of the albert terrace and the
splintered spire of the church the sun blazed dazzling in a clear sky
and here and there some facet in the great wilderness of roofs caught
the light and glared with a white intensity
northward were kilburn and hampsted blue and crowded with houses;
westward the great city was dimmed; and southward beyond the martians
the green waves of regent’s park the langham hotel the dome of the
albert hall the imperial institute and the giant mansions of the
brompton road came out clear and little in the sunrise the jagged
ruins of westminster rising hazily beyond far away and blue were the
surrey hills and the towers of the crystal palace glittered like two
silver rods the dome of st paul’s was dark against the sunrise and
injured i saw for the first time by a huge gaping cavity on its
western side
and as i looked at this wide expanse of houses and factories and
churches silent and abandoned; as i thought of the multitudinous hopes
and efforts the innumerable hosts of lives that had gone to build this
human reef and of the swift and ruthless destruction that had hung
over it all; when i realised that the shadow had been rolled back and
that men might still live in the streets and this dear vast dead city
of mine be once more alive and powerful i felt a wave of emotion that
was near akin to tears
the torment was over even that day the healing would begin the
survivors of the people scattered over the country—leaderless lawless
foodless like sheep without a shepherd—the thousands who had fled by
sea would begin to return; the pulse of life growing stronger and
stronger would beat again in the empty streets and pour across the
vacant squares whatever destruction was done the hand of the
destroyer was stayed all the gaunt wrecks the blackened skeletons of
houses that stared so dismally at the sunlit grass of the hill would
presently be echoing with the hammers of the restorers and ringing with
the tapping of their trowels at the thought i extended my hands
towards the sky and began thanking god in a year thought i—in a year
with overwhelming force came the thought of myself of my wife and the
old life of hope and tender helpfulness that had ceased for ever
and now comes the strangest thing in my story yet perhaps it is not
altogether strange i remember clearly and coldly and vividly all
that i did that day until the time that i stood weeping and praising
god upon the summit of primrose hill and then i forget
of the next three days i know nothing i have learned since that so
far from my being the first discoverer of the martian overthrow
several such wanderers as myself had already discovered this on the
previous night one man—the first—had gone to st martin’s-le-grand
and while i sheltered in the cabmen’s hut had contrived to telegraph
to paris thence the joyful news had flashed all over the world; a
thousand cities chilled by ghastly apprehensions suddenly flashed
into frantic illuminations; they knew of it in dublin edinburgh
manchester birmingham at the time when i stood upon the verge of the
pit already men weeping with joy as i have heard shouting and
staying their work to shake hands and shout were making up trains
even as near as crewe to descend upon london the church bells that
had ceased a fortnight since suddenly caught the news until all
england was bell-ringing men on cycles lean-faced unkempt scorched
along every country lane shouting of unhoped deliverance shouting to
gaunt staring figures of despair and for the food! across the
channel across the irish sea across the atlantic corn bread and
meat were tearing to our relief all the shipping in the world seemed
going londonward in those days but of all this i have no memory i
drifted—a demented man i found myself in a house of kindly people who
had found me on the third day wandering weeping and raving through
the streets of st john’s wood they have told me since that i was
singing some insane doggerel about “the last man left alive! hurrah!
the last man left alive!” troubled as they were with their own affairs
these people whose name much as i would like to express my gratitude
to them i may not even give here nevertheless cumbered themselves
with me sheltered me and protected me from myself apparently they
had learned something of my story from me during the days of my lapse
very gently when my mind was assured again did they break to me what
they had learned of the fate of leatherhead two days after i was
imprisoned it had been destroyed with every soul in it by a martian
he had swept it out of existence as it seemed without any
provocation as a boy might crush an ant hill in the mere wantonness
of power
i was a lonely man and they were very kind to me i was a lonely man
and a sad one and they bore with me i remained with them four days
after my recovery all that time i felt a vague a growing craving to
look once more on whatever remained of the little life that seemed so
happy and bright in my past it was a mere hopeless desire to feast
upon my misery they dissuaded me they did all they could to divert me
from this morbidity but at last i could resist the impulse no longer
and promising faithfully to return to them and parting as i will
confess from these four-day friends with tears i went out again into
the streets that had lately been so dark and strange and empty
already they were busy with returning people; in places even there were
shops open and i saw a drinking fountain running water
i remember how mockingly bright the day seemed as i went back on my
melancholy pilgrimage to the little house at woking how busy the
streets and vivid the moving life about me so many people were abroad
everywhere busied in a thousand activities that it seemed incredible
that any great proportion of the population could have been slain but
then i noticed how yellow were the skins of the people i met how
shaggy the hair of the men how large and bright their eyes and that
every other man still wore his dirty rags their faces seemed all with
one of two expressions—a leaping exultation and energy or a grim
resolution save for the expression of the faces london seemed a city
of tramps the vestries were indiscriminately distributing bread sent
us by the french government the ribs of the few horses showed
dismally haggard special constables with white badges stood at the
corners of every street i saw little of the mischief wrought by the
martians until i reached wellington street and there i saw the red
weed clambering over the buttresses of waterloo bridge
at the corner of the bridge too i saw one of the common contrasts of
that grotesque time—a sheet of paper flaunting against a thicket of the
red weed transfixed by a stick that kept it in place it was the
placard of the first newspaper to resume publication—the _daily mail_
i bought a copy for a blackened shilling i found in my pocket most of
it was in blank but the solitary compositor who did the thing had
amused himself by making a grotesque scheme of advertisement stereo on
the back page the matter he printed was emotional; the news
organisation had not as yet found its way back i learned nothing fresh
except that already in one week the examination of the martian
mechanisms had yielded astonishing results among other things the
article assured me what i did not believe at the time that the “secret
of flying” was discovered at waterloo i found the free trains that
were taking people to their homes the first rush was already over
there were few people in the train and i was in no mood for casual
conversation i got a compartment to myself and sat with folded arms
looking greyly at the sunlit devastation that flowed past the windows
and just outside the terminus the train jolted over temporary rails
and on either side of the railway the houses were blackened ruins to
clapham junction the face of london was grimy with powder of the black
smoke in spite of two days of thunderstorms and rain and at clapham
junction the line had been wrecked again; there were hundreds of
out-of-work clerks and shopmen working side by side with the customary
navvies and we were jolted over a hasty relaying
all down the line from there the aspect of the country was gaunt and
unfamiliar; wimbledon particularly had suffered walton by virtue of
its unburned pine woods seemed the least hurt of any place along the
line the wandle the mole every little stream was a heaped mass of
red weed in appearance between butcher’s meat and pickled cabbage the
surrey pine woods were too dry however for the festoons of the red
climber beyond wimbledon within sight of the line in certain nursery
grounds were the heaped masses of earth about the sixth cylinder a
number of people were standing about it and some sappers were busy in
the midst of it over it flaunted a union jack flapping cheerfully in
the morning breeze the nursery grounds were everywhere crimson with
the weed a wide expanse of livid colour cut with purple shadows and
very painful to the eye one’s gaze went with infinite relief from the
scorched greys and sullen reds of the foreground to the blue-green
softness of the eastward hills
the line on the london side of woking station was still undergoing
repair so i descended at byfleet station and took the road to maybury
past the place where i and the artilleryman had talked to the hussars
and on by the spot where the martian had appeared to me in the
thunderstorm here moved by curiosity i turned aside to find among a
tangle of red fronds the warped and broken dog cart with the whitened
bones of the horse scattered and gnawed for a time i stood regarding
these vestiges   
then i returned through the pine wood neck-high with red weed here and
there to find the landlord of the spotted dog had already found
burial and so came home past the college arms a man standing at an
open cottage door greeted me by name as i passed
i looked at my house with a quick flash of hope that faded immediately
the door had been forced; it was unfast and was opening slowly as i
approached
it slammed again the curtains of my study fluttered out of the open
window from which i and the artilleryman had watched the dawn no one
had closed it since the smashed bushes were just as i had left them
nearly four weeks ago i stumbled into the hall and the house felt
empty the stair carpet was ruffled and discoloured where i had
crouched soaked to the skin from the thunderstorm the night of the
catastrophe our muddy footsteps i saw still went up the stairs
i followed them to my study and found lying on my writing-table still
with the selenite paper weight upon it the sheet of work i had left on
the afternoon of the opening of the cylinder for a space i stood
reading over my abandoned arguments it was a paper on the probable
development of moral ideas with the development of the civilising
process; and the last sentence was the opening of a prophecy: “in about
two hundred years” i had written “we may expect——” the sentence ended
abruptly i remembered my inability to fix my mind that morning
scarcely a month gone by and how i had broken off to get my _daily
chronicle_ from the newsboy i remembered how i went down to the garden
gate as he came along and how i had listened to his odd story of “men
from mars”
i came down and went into the dining room there were the mutton and
the bread both far gone now in decay and a beer bottle overturned
just as i and the artilleryman had left them my home was desolate i
perceived the folly of the faint hope i had cherished so long and then
a strange thing occurred “it is no use” said a voice “the house is
deserted no one has been here these ten days do not stay here to
torment yourself no one escaped but you”
i was startled had i spoken my thought aloud i turned and the french
window was open behind me i made a step to it and stood looking out
and there amazed and afraid even as i stood amazed and afraid were
my cousin and my wife—my wife white and tearless she gave a faint cry
“i came” she said “i knew—knew——”
she put her hand to her throat—swayed i made a step forward and
caught her in my arms
i cannot but regret now that i am concluding my story how little i am
able to contribute to the discussion of the many debatable questions
which are still unsettled in one respect i shall certainly provoke
criticism my particular province is speculative philosophy my
knowledge of comparative physiology is confined to a book or two but
it seems to me that carver’s suggestions as to the reason of the rapid
death of the martians is so probable as to be regarded almost as a
proven conclusion i have assumed that in the body of my narrative
at any rate in all the bodies of the martians that were examined after
the war no bacteria except those already known as terrestrial species
were found that they did not bury any of their dead and the reckless
slaughter they perpetrated point also to an entire ignorance of the
putrefactive process but probable as this seems it is by no means a
proven conclusion
neither is the composition of the black smoke known which the martians
used with such deadly effect and the generator of the heat-rays
remains a puzzle the terrible disasters at the ealing and south
kensington laboratories have disinclined analysts for further
investigations upon the latter spectrum analysis of the black powder
points unmistakably to the presence of an unknown element with a
brilliant group of three lines in the green and it is possible that it
combines with argon to form a compound which acts at once with deadly
effect upon some constituent in the blood but such unproven
speculations will scarcely be of interest to the general reader to
whom this story is addressed none of the brown scum that drifted down
the thames after the destruction of shepperton was examined at the
time and now none is forthcoming
the results of an anatomical examination of the martians so far as the
prowling dogs had left such an examination possible i have already
given but everyone is familiar with the magnificent and almost
complete specimen in spirits at the natural history museum and the
countless drawings that have been made from it; and beyond that the
interest of their physiology and structure is purely scientific
a question of graver and universal interest is the possibility of
another attack from the martians i do not think that nearly enough
attention is being given to this aspect of the matter at present the
planet mars is in conjunction but with every return to opposition i
for one anticipate a renewal of their adventure in any case we
should be prepared it seems to me that it should be possible to define
the position of the gun from which the shots are discharged to keep a
sustained watch upon this part of the planet and to anticipate the
arrival of the next attack
in that case the cylinder might be destroyed with dynamite or artillery
before it was sufficiently cool for the martians to emerge or they
might be butchered by means of guns so soon as the screw opened it
seems to me that they have lost a vast advantage in the failure of
their first surprise possibly they see it in the same light
lessing has advanced excellent reasons for supposing that the martians
have actually succeeded in effecting a landing on the planet venus
seven months ago now venus and mars were in alignment with the sun;
that is to say mars was in opposition from the point of view of an
observer on venus subsequently a peculiar luminous and sinuous marking
appeared on the unillumined half of the inner planet and almost
simultaneously a faint dark mark of a similar sinuous character was
detected upon a photograph of the martian disk one needs to see the
drawings of these appearances in order to appreciate fully their
remarkable resemblance in character
at any rate whether we expect another invasion or not our views of
the human future must be greatly modified by these events we have
learned now that we cannot regard this planet as being fenced in and a
secure abiding place for man; we can never anticipate the unseen good
or evil that may come upon us suddenly out of space it may be that in
the larger design of the universe this invasion from mars is not
without its ultimate benefit for men; it has robbed us of that serene
confidence in the future which is the most fruitful source of
decadence the gifts to human science it has brought are enormous and
it has done much to promote the conception of the commonweal of
mankind it may be that across the immensity of space the martians have
watched the fate of these pioneers of theirs and learned their lesson
and that on the planet venus they have found a securer settlement be
that as it may for many years yet there will certainly be no
relaxation of the eager scrutiny of the martian disk and those fiery
darts of the sky the shooting stars will bring with them as they fall
an unavoidable apprehension to all the sons of men
the broadening of men’s views that has resulted can scarcely be
exaggerated before the cylinder fell there was a general persuasion
that through all the deep of space no life existed beyond the petty
surface of our minute sphere now we see further if the martians can
reach venus there is no reason to suppose that the thing is impossible
for men and when the slow cooling of the sun makes this earth
uninhabitable as at last it must do it may be that the thread of life
that has begun here will have streamed out and caught our sister planet
within its toils
dim and wonderful is the vision i have conjured up in my mind of life
spreading slowly from this little seed bed of the solar system
throughout the inanimate vastness of sidereal space but that is a
remote dream it may be on the other hand that the destruction of the
martians is only a reprieve to them and not to us perhaps is the
future ordained
i must confess the stress and danger of the time have left an abiding
sense of doubt and insecurity in my mind i sit in my study writing by
lamplight and suddenly i see again the healing valley below set with
writhing flames and feel the house behind and about me empty and
desolate i go out into the byfleet road and vehicles pass me a
butcher boy in a cart a cabful of visitors a workman on a bicycle
children going to school and suddenly they become vague and unreal
and i hurry again with the artilleryman through the hot brooding
silence of a night i see the black powder darkening the silent
streets and the contorted bodies shrouded in that layer; they rise
upon me tattered and dog-bitten they gibber and grow fiercer paler
uglier mad distortions of humanity at last and i wake cold and
wretched in the darkness of the night
i go to london and see the busy multitudes in fleet street and the
strand and it comes across my mind that they are but the ghosts of the
past haunting the streets that i have seen silent and wretched going
to and fro phantasms in a dead city the mockery of life in a
galvanised body and strange too it is to stand on primrose hill as
i did but a day before writing this last chapter to see the great
province of houses dim and blue through the haze of the smoke and
mist vanishing at last into the vague lower sky to see the people
walking to and fro among the flower beds on the hill to see the
sight-seers about the martian machine that stands there still to hear
the tumult of playing children and to recall the time when i saw it
all bright and clear-cut hard and silent under the dawn of that last
great day   
and strangest of all is it to hold my wife’s hand again and to think
that i have counted her and that she has counted me among the dead
  "i was born in boston new england and owe my first
  instructions in literature to the free grammar-schools
  established there i therefore give one hundred pounds
  sterling to my executors to be by them  paid over to
  the managers or directors of the free schools in my native
  town of boston to be by them  put out to interest and
  so continued at interest forever which interest annually
  shall be laid out in silver medals and given as honorary
  rewards annually by the directors of the said free schools
  belonging to the said town in such manner as to the
  discretion of the selectmen of the said town shall seem
  meet"

introduction
we americans devour eagerly any piece of writing that purports to tell
us the secret of success in life; yet how often we are disappointed to
find nothing but commonplace statements or receipts that we know by
heart but never follow most of the life stories of our famous and
successful men fail to inspire because they lack the human element
that makes the record real and brings the story within our grasp
while we are searching far and near for some aladdin's lamp to give
coveted fortune there is ready at our hand if we will only reach out
and take it like the charm in milton's _comus_
  "unknown and like esteemed and the dull swain
   treads on it daily with his clouted shoon;"
the interesting human and vividly told story of one of the wisest
and most useful lives in our own history and perhaps in any history
in franklin's _autobiography_ is offered not so much a ready-made
formula for success as the companionship of a real flesh and blood
man of extraordinary mind and quality whose daily walk and
conversation will help us to meet our own difficulties much as does
the example of a wise and strong friend while we are fascinated by
the story we absorb the human experience through which a strong and
helpful character is building
the thing that makes franklin's _autobiography_ different from every
other life story of a great and successful man is just this human
aspect of the account franklin told the story of his life as he
himself says for the benefit of his posterity he wanted to help them
by the relation of his own rise from obscurity and poverty to eminence
and wealth he is not unmindful of the importance of his public
services and their recognition yet his accounts of these achievements
are given only as a part of the story and the vanity displayed is
incidental and in keeping with the honesty of the recital there is
nothing of the impossible in the method and practice of franklin as he
sets them forth the youth who reads the fascinating story is
astonished to find that franklin in his early years struggled with the
same everyday passions and difficulties that he himself experiences
and he loses the sense of discouragement that comes from a
realization of his own shortcomings and inability to attain
there are other reasons why the _autobiography_ should be an intimate
friend of american young people here they may establish a close
relationship with one of the foremost americans as well as one of the
wisest men of his age
the life of benjamin franklin is of importance to every american
primarily because of the part he played in securing the independence
of the united states and in establishing it as a nation franklin
shares with washington the honors of the revolution and of the events
leading to the birth of the new nation while washington was the
animating spirit of the struggle in the colonies franklin was its
ablest champion abroad to franklin's cogent reasoning and keen
satire we owe the clear and forcible presentation of the american
case in england and france; while to his personality and diplomacy as
well as to his facile pen we are indebted for the foreign alliance
and the funds without which washington's work must have failed his
patience fortitude and practical wisdom coupled with
self-sacrificing devotion to the cause of his country are hardly less
noticeable than similar qualities displayed by washington in fact
franklin as a public man was much like washington especially in the
entire disinterestedness of his public service
franklin is also interesting to us because by his life and teachings
he has done more than any other american to advance the material
prosperity of his countrymen it is said that his widely and
faithfully read maxims made philadelphia and pennsylvania wealthy
while poor richard's pithy sayings translated into many languages
have had a world-wide influence
franklin is a good type of our american manhood although not the
wealthiest or the most powerful he is undoubtedly in the versatility
of his genius and achievements the greatest of our self-made men the
simple yet graphic story in the _autobiography_ of his steady rise
from humble boyhood in a tallow-chandler shop by industry economy
and perseverance in self-improvement to eminence is the most
remarkable of all the remarkable histories of our self-made men it is
in itself a wonderful illustration of the results possible to be
attained in a land of unequaled opportunity by following franklin's
maxims
franklin's fame however was not confined to his own country
although he lived in a century notable for the rapid evolution of
scientific and political thought and activity yet no less a keen
judge and critic than lord jeffrey the famous editor of the
_edinburgh review_ a century ago said that "in one point of view
the name of franklin must be considered as standing higher than any of
the others which illustrated the eighteenth century distinguished as
a statesman he was equally great as a philosopher thus uniting in
himself a rare degree of excellence in both these pursuits to excel
in either of which is deemed the highest praise"
franklin has indeed been aptly called "many-sided" he was eminent in
science and public service in diplomacy and in literature he was the
edison of his day turning his scientific discoveries to the benefit
of his fellow-men he perceived the identity of lightning and
electricity and set up the lightning rod he invented the franklin
stove still widely used and refused to patent it he possessed a
masterly shrewdness in business and practical affairs carlyle called
him the father of all the yankees he founded a fire company assisted
in founding a hospital and improved the cleaning and lighting of
streets he developed journalism established the american
philosophical society the public library in philadelphia and the
university of pennsylvania he organized a postal system for the
colonies which was the basis of the present united states post
office bancroft the eminent historian called him "the greatest
diplomatist of his century" he perfected the albany plan of union for
the colonies he is the only statesman who signed the declaration of
independence the treaty of alliance with france the treaty of peace
with england and the constitution as a writer he has produced in
his _autobiography_ and in _poor richard's almanac_ two works that
are not surpassed by similar writing he received honorary degrees
from harvard and yale from oxford and st andrews and was made a
fellow of the royal society which awarded him the copley gold medal
for improving natural knowledge he was one of the eight foreign
associates of the french academy of science
the careful study of the _autobiography_ is also valuable because of
the style in which it is written if robert louis stevenson is right
in believing that his remarkable style was acquired by imitation then
the youth who would gain the power to express his ideas clearly
forcibly and interestingly cannot do better than to study franklin's
method franklin's fame in the scientific world was due almost as much
to his modest simple and sincere manner of presenting his
discoveries and to the precision and clearness of the style in which
he described his experiments as to the results he was able to
announce sir humphry davy the celebrated english chemist himself an
excellent literary critic as well as a great scientist said: "a
singular felicity guided all franklin's researches and by very small
means he established very grand truths the style and manner of his
publication on electricity are almost as worthy of admiration as the
doctrine it contains"
franklin's place in literature is hard to determine because he was not
primarily a literary man his aim in his writings as in his life work
was to be helpful to his fellow-men for him writing was never an end
in itself but always a means to an end yet his success as a
scientist a statesman and a diplomat as well as socially was in no
little part due to his ability as a writer "his letters charmed all
and made his correspondence eagerly sought his political arguments
were the joy of his party and the dread of his opponents his
scientific discoveries were explained in language at once so simple
and so clear that plow-boy and exquisite could follow his thought or
his experiment to its conclusion"[]
    [] _the many-sided franklin_ paul l ford
as far as american literature is concerned franklin has no
contemporaries before the _autobiography_ only one literary work of
importance had been produced in this country--cotton mather's
_magnalia_ a church history of new england in a ponderous stiff
style franklin was the first american author to gain a wide and
permanent reputation in europe the _autobiography_ _poor richard_
_father abraham's speech_ or _the way to wealth_ as well as some of
the _bagatelles_ are as widely known abroad as any american writings
franklin must also be classed as the first american humorist
english literature of the eighteenth century was characterized by the
development of prose periodical literature reached its perfection
early in the century in _the tatler_ and _the spectator_ of addison
and steele pamphleteers flourished throughout the period the
homelier prose of bunyan and defoe gradually gave place to the more
elegant and artificial language of samuel johnson who set the
standard for prose writing from  onward this century saw the
beginnings of the modern novel in fielding's _tom jones_
richardson's _clarissa harlowe_ sterne's _tristram shandy_ and
goldsmith's _vicar of wakefield_ gibbon wrote _the decline and fall
of the roman empire_ hume his _history of england_ and adam smith
the _wealth of nations_
in the simplicity and vigor of his style franklin more nearly
resembles the earlier group of writers in his first essays he was not
an inferior imitator of addison in his numerous parables moral
allegories and apologues he showed bunyan's influence but franklin
was essentially a journalist in his swift terse style he is most
like defoe who was the first great english journalist and master of
the newspaper narrative the style of both writers is marked by
homely vigorous expression satire burlesque repartee here the
comparison must end defoe and his contemporaries were authors their
vocation was writing and their success rests on the imaginative or
creative power they displayed to authorship franklin laid no claim
he wrote no work of the imagination he developed only incidentally a
style in many respects as remarkable as that of his english
contemporaries he wrote the best autobiography in existence one of
the most widely known collections of maxims and an unsurpassed series
of political and social satires because he was a man of unusual scope
of power and usefulness who knew how to tell his fellow-men the
secrets of that power and that usefulness
the story of the autobiography
the account of how franklin's _autobiography_ came to be written and
of the adventures of the original manuscript forms in itself an
interesting story the _autobiography_ is franklin's longest work
and yet it is only a fragment the first part written as a letter to
his son william franklin was not intended for publication; and the
composition is more informal and the narrative more personal than in
the second part from  on which was written with a view to
publication the entire manuscript shows little evidence of revision
in fact the expression is so homely and natural that his grandson
william temple franklin in editing the work changed some of the
phrases because he thought them inelegant and vulgar
franklin began the story of his life while on a visit to his friend
bishop shipley at twyford in hampshire southern england in 
he took the manuscript completed to  with him when he returned
to philadelphia in  it was left there with his other papers when
he went to france in the following year and disappeared during the
confusion incident to the revolution twenty-three pages of closely
written manuscript fell into the hands of abel james an old friend
who sent a copy to franklin at passy near paris urging him to
complete the story franklin took up the work at passy in  and
carried the narrative forward a few months he changed the plan to
meet his new purpose of writing to benefit the young reader his work
was soon interrupted and was not resumed until  when he was at
home in philadelphia he was now old infirm and suffering and was
still engaged in public service under these discouraging conditions
the work progressed slowly it finally stopped when the narrative
reached the year  copies of the manuscript were sent to friends
of franklin in england and france among others to monsieur le
veillard at paris
the first edition of the _autobiography_ was published in french at
paris in  it was clumsily and carelessly translated and was
imperfect and unfinished where the translator got the manuscript is
not known le veillard disclaimed any knowledge of the publication
from this faulty french edition many others were printed some in
germany two in england and another in france so great was the
demand for the work
in the meantime the original manuscript of the _autobiography_ had
started on a varied and adventurous career it was left by franklin
with his other works to his grandson william temple franklin whom
franklin designated as his literary executor when temple franklin
came to publish his grandfather's works in  he sent the original
manuscript of the _autobiography_ to the daughter of le veillard in
exchange for her father's copy probably thinking the clearer
transcript would make better printer's copy the original manuscript
thus found its way to the le veillard family and connections where it
remained until sold in  to mr john bigelow united states
minister to france by him it was later sold to mr e dwight church
of new york and passed with the rest of mr church's library into the
possession of mr henry e huntington the original manuscript of
franklin's _autobiography_ now rests in the vault in mr huntington's
residence at fifth avenue and fifty-seventh street new york city
when mr bigelow came to examine his purchase he was astonished to
find that what people had been reading for years as the authentic
_life of benjamin franklin by himself_ was only a garbled and
incomplete version of the real _autobiography_ temple franklin had
taken unwarranted liberties with the original mr bigelow says he
found more than twelve hundred changes in the text in 
therefore mr bigelow published the standard edition of franklin's
_autobiography_ it corrected errors in the previous editions and was
the first english edition to contain the short fourth part
comprising the last few pages of the manuscript written during the
last year of franklin's life mr bigelow republished the
_autobiography_ with additional interesting matter in three volumes
in  in  and in  the text in this volume is that of mr
bigelow's editions[]
    [] for the division into chapters and the chapter
    titles however the present editor is responsible
the _autobiography_ has been reprinted in the united states many
scores of times and translated into all the languages of europe it
has never lost its popularity and is still in constant demand at
circulating libraries the reason for this popularity is not far to
seek for in this work franklin told in a remarkable manner the story
of a remarkable life he displayed hard common sense and a practical
knowledge of the art of living he selected and arranged his material
perhaps unconsciously with the unerring instinct of the journalist
for the best effects his success is not a little due to his plain
clear vigorous english he used short sentences and words homely
expressions apt illustrations and pointed allusions franklin had a
most interesting varied and unusual life he was one of the greatest
conversationalists of his time
his book is the record of that unusual life told in franklin's own
unexcelled conversational style it is said that the best parts of
boswell's famous biography of samuel johnson are those parts where
boswell permits johnson to tell his own story in the _autobiography_
a no less remarkable man and talker than samuel johnson is telling his
own story throughout

autobiography
of
benjamin franklin
i
ancestry and early youth in
boston
  twyford[] _at the bishop of st asaph's_ 
dear son: i have ever had pleasure in obtaining any little anecdotes
of my ancestors you may remember the inquiries i made among the
remains of my relations when you were with me in england and the
journey i undertook for that purpose imagining it may be equally
agreeable to you to know the circumstances of my life many of which
you are yet unacquainted with and expecting the enjoyment of a week's
uninterrupted leisure in my present country retirement i sit down to
write them for you to which i have besides some other inducements
having emerged from the poverty and obscurity in which i was born and
bred to a state of affluence and some degree of reputation in the
world and having gone so far through life with a considerable share
of felicity the conducing means i made use of which with the
blessing of god so well succeeded my posterity may like to know as
they may find some of them suitable to their own situations and
therefore fit to be imitated
    [] a small village not far from winchester in
    hampshire southern england here was the country seat
    of the bishop of st asaph dr jonathan shipley the
    "good bishop" as dr franklin used to style him their
    relations were intimate and confidential in his pulpit
    and in the house of lords as well as in society the
    bishop always opposed the harsh measures of the crown
    toward the colonies--bigelow
that felicity when i reflected on it has induced me sometimes to
say that were it offered to my choice i should have no objection to
a repetition of the same life from its beginning only asking the
advantages authors have in a second edition to correct some faults of
the first so i might besides correcting the faults change some
sinister accidents and events of it for others more favourable but
though this were denied i should still accept the offer since such a
repetition is not to be expected the next thing most like living
one's life over again seems to be a recollection of that life and to
make that recollection as durable as possible by putting it down in
writing
hereby too i shall indulge the inclination so natural in old men to
be talking of themselves and their own past actions; and i shall
indulge it without being tiresome to others who through respect to
age might conceive themselves obliged to give me a hearing since
this may be read or not as anyone pleases and lastly (i may as well
confess it since my denial of it will be believed by nobody) perhaps
i shall a good deal gratify my own _vanity_[] indeed i scarce ever
heard or saw the introductory words "_without vanity i may say_"
etc but some vain thing immediately followed most people dislike
vanity in others whatever share they have of it themselves; but i
give it fair quarter wherever i meet with it being persuaded that it
is often productive of good to the possessor and to others that are
within his sphere of action; and therefore in many cases it would
not be altogether absurd if a man were to thank god for his vanity
among the other comforts of life
    [] in this connection woodrow wilson says "and yet the
    surprising and delightful thing about this book (the
    _autobiography_) is that take it all in all it has not
    the low tone of conceit but is a staunch man's sober
    and unaffected assessment of himself and the
    circumstances of his career"
    gibbon and hume the great british historians who were
    contemporaries of franklin express in their
    autobiographies the same feeling about the propriety of
    just self-praise
and now i speak of thanking god i desire with all humility to
acknowledge that i owe the mentioned happiness of my past life to his
kind providence which lead me to the means i used and gave them
success my belief of this induces me to _hope_ though i must not
_presume_ that the same goodness will still be exercised toward me
in continuing that happiness or enabling me to bear a fatal reverse
which i may experience as others have done; the complexion of my
future fortune being known to him only in whose power it is to bless
to us even our afflictions
the notes one of my uncles (who had the same kind of curiosity in
collecting family anecdotes) once put into my hands furnished me with
several particulars relating to our ancestors from these notes i
learned that the family had lived in the same village ecton in
northamptonshire[] for three hundred years and how much longer he
knew not (perhaps from the time when the name of franklin that before
was the name of an order of people[] was assumed by them as a
surname when others took surnames all over the kingdom) on a freehold
of about thirty acres aided by the smith's business which had
continued in the family till his time the eldest son being always
bred to that business; a custom which he and my father followed as to
their eldest sons when i searched the registers at ecton i found an
account of their births marriages and burials from the year 
only there being no registers kept in that parish at any time
preceding by that register i perceived that i was the youngest son of
the youngest son for five generations back my grandfather thomas who
was born in  lived at ecton till he grew too old to follow
business longer when he went to live with his son john a dyer at
banbury in oxfordshire with whom my father served an apprenticeship

 his eldest son thomas lived in the house at ecton and left it
with the land to his only child a daughter who with her husband
one fisher of wellingborough sold it to mr isted now lord of the

thomas was bred a smith under his father; but being ingenious and
encouraged in learning (as all my brothers were) by an esquire palmer
then the principal gentleman in that parish he qualified himself for
the business of scrivener; became a considerable man in the county;
was a chief mover of all public-spirited undertakings for the county
or town of northampton and his own village of which many instances
were related of him; and much taken notice of and patronized by the
then lord halifax he died in  january  old style[] just four
years to a day before i was born the account we received of his life

remember him well for when i was a boy he came over to my father in
boston and lived in the house with us some years he lived to a
great age his grandson samuel franklin now lives in boston he left
behind him two quarto volumes ms of his own poetry consisting of
little occasional pieces addressed to his friends and relations of
which the following sent to me is a specimen[] he had formed a
short-hand of his own which he taught me but never practising it i
have now forgot it i was named after this uncle there being a
particular affection between him and my father he was very pious a
great attender of sermons of the best preachers which he took down in
his short-hand and had with him many volumes of them he was also
much of a politician; too much perhaps for his station there fell
lately into my hands in london a collection he had made of all the
principal pamphlets relating to public affairs from  to ;
many of the volumes are wanting as appears by the numbering but
there still remain eight volumes in folio and twenty-four in quarto
and in octavo a dealer in old books met with them and knowing me by
my sometimes buying of him he brought them to me it seems my uncle
must have left them here when he went to america which was about
fifty years since there are many of his notes in the margins

this obscure family of ours was early in the reformation and
continued protestants through the reign of queen mary when they were
sometimes in danger of trouble on account of their zeal against
popery they had got an english bible and to conceal and secure it
it was fastened open with tapes under and within the cover of a
joint-stool when my great-great-grandfather read it to his family he
turned up the joint-stool upon his knees turning over the leaves then
under the tapes one of the children stood at the door to give notice
if he saw the apparitor coming who was an officer of the spiritual
court in that case the stool was turned down again upon its feet
when the bible remained concealed under it as before this anecdote i
had from my uncle benjamin the family continued all of the church of
england till about the end of charles the second's reign when some of
the ministers that had been outed for non-conformity holding
conventicles[] in northamptonshire benjamin and josiah adhered to
them and so continued all their lives: the rest of the family
remained with the episcopal church

children into new england about  the conventicles having been
forbidden by law and frequently disturbed induced some considerable
men of his acquaintance to remove to that country and he was
prevailed with to accompany them thither where they expected to enjoy
their mode of religion with freedom by the same wife he had four
children more born there and by a second wife ten more in all
seventeen; of which i remember thirteen sitting at one time at his
table who all grew up to be men and women and married; i was the
youngest son and the youngest child but two and was born in boston

whom honorable mention is made by cotton mather[] in his church
history of that country entitled _magnalia christi americana_ as "_a
godly learned englishman_" if i remember the words rightly i have
heard that he wrote sundry small occasional pieces but only one of
them was printed which i saw now many years since it was written in
 in the home-spun verse of that time and people and addressed to
those then concerned in the government there it was in favour of
liberty of conscience and in behalf of the baptists quakers and
other sectaries that had been under persecution ascribing the indian
wars and other distresses that had befallen the country to that
persecution as so many judgments of god to punish so heinous an
offense and exhorting a repeal of those uncharitable laws the whole
appeared to me as written with a good deal of decent plainness and
manly freedom the six concluding lines i remember though i have
forgotten the two first of the stanza; but the purport of them was
that his censures proceeded from good-will and therefore he would
be known to be the author

my elder brothers were all put apprentices to different trades i was
put to the grammar-school at eight years of age my father intending
to devote me as the tithe[] of his sons to the service of the
church my early readiness in learning to read (which must have been
very early as i do not remember when i could not read) and the
opinion of all his friends that i should certainly make a good
scholar encouraged him in this purpose of his my uncle benjamin
too approved of it and proposed to give me all his short-hand
volumes of sermons i suppose as a stock to set up with if i would
learn his character[] i continued however at the grammar-school
not quite one year though in that time i had risen gradually from the
middle of the class of that year to be the head of it and farther was
removed into the next class above it in order to go with that into
the third at the end of the year but my father in the meantime from
a view of the expense of a college education which having so large a
family he could not well afford and the mean living many so educated
were afterwards able to obtain--reasons that he gave to his friends in
my hearing--altered his first intention took me from the
grammar-school and sent me to a school for writing and arithmetic
kept by a then famous man mr george brownell very successful in
his profession generally and that by mild encouraging methods under
him i acquired fair writing pretty soon but i failed in the
arithmetic and made no progress in it at ten years old i was taken
home to assist my father in his business which was that of a
tallow-chandler and sope-boiler; a business he was not bred to but
had assumed on his arrival in new england and on finding his dyeing
trade would not maintain his family being in little request

i disliked the trade and had a strong inclination for the sea but my
father declared against it; however living near the water i was much
in and about it learnt early to swim well and to manage boats; and
when in a boat or canoe with other boys i was commonly allowed to
govern especially in any case of difficulty; and upon other occasions
i was generally a leader among the boys and sometimes led them into
scrapes of which i will mention one instance as it shows an early
projecting public spirit tho' not then justly conducted
there was a salt-marsh that bounded part of the mill-pond on the edge
of which at high water we used to stand to fish for minnows by much
trampling we had made it a mere quagmire my proposal was to build a
wharf there fit for us to stand upon and i showed my comrades a large
heap of stones which were intended for a new house near the marsh
and which would very well suit our purpose accordingly in the
evening when the workmen were gone i assembled a number of my
playfellows and working with them diligently like so many emmets
sometimes two or three to a stone we brought them all away and built
our little wharf the next morning the workmen were surprised at
missing the stones which were found in our wharf inquiry was made
after the removers; we were discovered and complained of; several of
us were corrected by our fathers; and though i pleaded the usefulness
of the work mine convinced me that nothing was useful which was not
honest
i think you may like to know something of his person and character he
had an excellent constitution of body was of middle stature but well
set and very strong; he was ingenious could draw prettily was
skilled a little in music and had a clear pleasing voice so that
when he played psalm tunes on his violin and sung withal as he
sometimes did in an evening after the business of the day was over it
was extremely agreeable to hear he had a mechanical genius too and
on occasion was very handy in the use of other tradesmen's tools; but
his great excellence lay in a sound understanding and solid judgment
in prudential matters both in private and publick affairs in the
latter indeed he was never employed the numerous family he had to
educate and the straitness of his circumstances keeping him close to
his trade; but i remember well his being frequently visited by leading
people who consulted him for his opinion in affairs of the town or of
the church he belonged to and showed a good deal of respect for his
judgment and advice: he was also much consulted by private persons
about their affairs when any difficulty occurred and frequently
chosen an arbitrator between contending parties at his table he liked
to have as often as he could some sensible friend or neighbor to
converse with and always took care to start some ingenious or useful
topic for discourse which might tend to improve the minds of his
children by this means he turned our attention to what was good
just and prudent in the conduct of life; and little or no notice was
ever taken of what related to the victuals on the table whether it
was well or ill dressed in or out of season of good or bad flavor
preferable or inferior to this or that other thing of the kind so
that i was bro't up in such a perfect inattention to those matters as
to be quite indifferent what kind of food was set before me and so
unobservant of it that to this day if i am asked i can scarce tell a
few hours after dinner what i dined upon this has been a convenience
to me in traveling where my companions have been sometimes very
unhappy for want of a suitable gratification of their more delicate
because better instructed tastes and appetites

by my rambling digressions i perceive myself to be grown old i us'd
to write more methodically but one does not dress for private company
as for a publick ball 'tis perhaps only negligence
to return: i continued thus employed in my father's business for two
years that is till i was twelve years old; and my brother john who
was bred to that business having left my father married and set up
for himself at rhode island there was all appearance that i was
destined to supply his place and become a tallow-chandler but my
dislike to the trade continuing my father was under apprehensions
that if he did not find one for me more agreeable i should break away
and get to sea as his son josiah had done to his great vexation he
therefore sometimes took me to walk with him and see joiners
bricklayers turners braziers etc at their work that he might
observe my inclination and endeavor to fix it on some trade or other
on land it has ever since been a pleasure to me to see good workmen
handle their tools; and it has been useful to me having learnt so
much by it as to be able to do little jobs myself in my house when a
workman could not readily be got and to construct little machines for
my experiments while the intention of making the experiment was fresh
and warm in my mind my father at last fixed upon the cutler's trade
and my uncle benjamin's son samuel who was bred to that business in
london being about that time established in boston i was sent to be
with him some time on liking but his expectations of a fee with me
displeasing my father i was taken home again

beginning life as a printer
from a child i was fond of reading and all the little money that came
into my hands was ever laid out in books pleased with the _pilgrim's
progress_ my first collection was of john bunyan's works in separate
little volumes i afterward sold them to enable me to buy r burton's
_historical collections_; they were small chapmen's books[] and
cheap  or  in all my father's little library consisted chiefly
of books in polemic divinity most of which i read and have since
often regretted that at a time when i had such a thirst for
knowledge more proper books had not fallen in my way since it was
now resolved i should not be a clergyman plutarch's _lives_ there was
in which i read abundantly and i still think that time spent to great
advantage there was also a book of defoe's called an _essay on
projects_ and another of dr mather's called _essays to do good_
which perhaps gave me a turn of thinking that had an influence on
some of the principal future events of my life
    [] small books sold by chapmen or peddlers
this bookish inclination at length determined my father to make me a
printer though he had already one son (james) of that profession in
 my brother james returned from england with a press and letters
to set up his business in boston i liked it much better than that of
my father but still had a hankering for the sea to prevent the
apprehended effect of such an inclination my father was impatient to
have me bound to my brother i stood out some time but at last was
persuaded and signed the indentures when i was yet but twelve years
old i was to serve as an apprentice till i was twenty-one years of
age only i was to be allowed journeyman's wages during the last year
in a little time i made great proficiency in the business and became
a useful hand to my brother i now had access to better books an
acquaintance with the apprentices of booksellers enabled me sometimes
to borrow a small one which i was careful to return soon and clean
often i sat up in my room reading the greatest part of the night when
the book was borrowed in the evening and to be returned early in the
morning lest it should be missed or wanted
and after some time an ingenious tradesman mr matthew adams who
had a pretty collection of books and who frequented our
printing-house took notice of me invited me to his library and
very kindly lent me such books as i chose to read i now took a fancy
to poetry and made some little pieces; my brother thinking it might
turn to account encouraged me and put me on composing occasional
ballads one was called _the lighthouse tragedy_ and contained an
account of the drowning of captain worthilake with his two daughters:
the other was a sailor's song on the taking of _teach_ (or
blackbeard) the pirate they were wretched stuff in the
grub-street-ballad style;[] and when they were printed he sent me
about the town to sell them the first sold wonderfully the event
being recent having made a great noise this flattered my vanity; but
my father discouraged me by ridiculing my performances and telling me
verse-makers were generally beggars so i escaped being a poet most
probably a very bad one; but as prose writing has been of great use to
me in the course of my life and was a principal means of my
advancement i shall tell you how in such a situation i acquired
what little ability i have in that way
    [] grub-street: famous in english literature as the
    home of poor writers
there was another bookish lad in the town john collins by name with
whom i was intimately acquainted we sometimes disputed and very fond
we were of argument and very desirous of confuting one another
which disputatious turn by the way is apt to become a very bad
habit making people often extremely disagreeable in company by the
contradiction that is necessary to bring it into practice; and thence
besides souring and spoiling the conversation is productive of
disgusts and perhaps enmities where you may have occasion for
friendship i had caught it by reading my father's books of dispute
about religion persons of good sense i have since observed seldom
fall into it except lawyers university men and men of all sorts
that have been bred at edinborough
a question was once somehow or other started between collins and me
of the propriety of educating the female sex in learning and their
abilities for study he was of opinion that it was improper and that
they were naturally unequal to it i took the contrary side perhaps a
little for dispute's sake he was naturally more eloquent had a ready
plenty of words and sometimes as i thought bore me down more by his
fluency than by the strength of his reasons as we parted without
settling the point and were not to see one another again for some
time i sat down to put my arguments in writing which i copied fair
and sent to him he answered and i replied three or four letters of
a side had passed when my father happened to find my papers and read
them without entering into the discussion he took occasion to talk
to me about the manner of my writing; observed that though i had the
advantage of my antagonist in correct spelling and pointing (which i
ow'd to the printing-house) i fell far short in elegance of
expression in method and in perspicuity of which he convinced me by
several instances i saw the justice of his remarks and thence grew
more attentive to the manner in writing and determined to endeavor at
improvement
about this time i met with an odd volume of the _spectator_[] it was
the third i had never before seen any of them i bought it read it
over and over and was much delighted with it i thought the writing
excellent and wished if possible to imitate it with this view i
took some of the papers and making short hints of the sentiment in
each sentence laid them by a few days and then without looking at
the book try'd to compleat the papers again by expressing each
hinted sentiment at length and as fully as it had been expressed
before in any suitable words that should come to hand then i
compared my _spectator_ with the original discovered some of my
faults and corrected them but i found i wanted a stock of words or
a readiness in recollecting and using them which i thought i should
have acquired before that time if i had gone on making verses; since
the continual occasion for words of the same import but of different
length to suit the measure or of different sound for the rhyme
would have laid me under a constant necessity of searching for
variety and also have tended to fix that variety in my mind and make
me master of it therefore i took some of the tales and turned them
into verse; and after a time when i had pretty well forgotten the
prose turned them back again i also sometimes jumbled my collections
of hints into confusion and after some weeks endeavored to reduce
them into the best order before i began to form the full sentences
and compleat the paper this was to teach me method in the arrangement
of thoughts by comparing my work afterwards with the original i
discovered many faults and amended them; but i sometimes had the
pleasure of fancying that in certain particulars of small import i
had been lucky enough to improve the method of the language and this
encouraged me to think i might possibly in time come to be a tolerable
english writer of which i was extremely ambitious my time for these
exercises and for reading was at night after work or before it began
in the morning or on sundays when i contrived to be in the
printing-house alone evading as much as i could the common attendance
on public worship which my father used to exact of me when i was under
his care and which indeed i still thought a duty thought i could
not as it seemed to me afford time to practise it

one tryon recommending a vegetable diet i determined to go into it
my brother being yet unmarried did not keep house but boarded
himself and his apprentices in another family my refusing to eat
flesh occasioned an inconveniency and i was frequently chid for my
singularity i made myself acquainted with tryon's manner of preparing
some of his dishes such as boiling potatoes or rice making hasty
pudding and a few others and then proposed to my brother that if he
would give me weekly half the money he paid for my board i would
board myself he instantly agreed to it and i presently found that i
could save half what he paid me this was an additional fund for
buying books but i had another advantage in it my brother and the
rest going from the printing-house to their meals i remained there
alone and dispatching presently my light repast which often was no
more than a bisket or a slice of bread a handful of raisins or a tart
from the pastry-cook's and a glass of water had the rest of the time
till their return for study in which i made the greater progress

usually attend temperance in eating and drinking

ignorance in figures which i had twice failed in learning when at
school i took cocker's book of arithmetick and went through the
whole by myself with great ease i also read seller's and shermy's
books of navigation and became acquainted with the little geometry
they contain; but never proceeded far in that science and i read

grammar (i think it was greenwood's) at the end of which there were
two little sketches of the arts of rhetoric and logic the latter
finishing with a specimen of a dispute in the socratic[] method; and
soon after i procur'd xenophon's memorable things of socrates wherein
there are many instances of the same method i was charm'd with it
adopted it dropt my abrupt contradiction and positive argumentation
and put on the humble inquirer and doubter and being then from
reading shaftesbury and collins become a real doubter in many points
of our religious doctrine i found this method safest for myself and
very embarrassing to those against whom i used it; therefore i took a
delight in it practis'd it continually and grew very artful and
expert in drawing people even of superior knowledge into
concessions the consequences of which they did not foresee
entangling them in difficulties out of which they could not extricate
themselves and so obtaining victories that neither myself nor my
cause always deserved i continu'd this method some few years but
gradually left it retaining only the habit of expressing myself in
terms of modest diffidence; never using when i advanced anything that
may possibly be disputed the words _certainly_ _undoubtedly_ or any
others that give the air of positiveness to an opinion; but rather
say i conceive or apprehend a thing to be so and so; it appears to
me or _i should think it so or so_ for such and such reasons; or _i
imagine it to be so_; or _it is so if i am not mistaken_ this habit
i believe has been of great advantage to me when i have had occasion
to inculcate my opinions and persuade men into measures that i have
been from time to time engaged in promoting; and as the chief ends of
conversation are to _inform_ or to be _informed_ to _please_ or to
_persuade_ i wish well-meaning sensible men would not lessen their
power of doing good by a positive assuming manner that seldom fails
to disgust tends to create opposition and to defeat everyone of
those purposes for which speech was given to us to wit giving or
receiving information or pleasure for if you would inform a
positive and dogmatical manner in advancing your sentiments may
provoke contradiction and prevent a candid attention if you wish
information and improvement from the knowledge of others and yet at
the same time express yourself as firmly fix'd in your present
opinions modest sensible men who do not love disputation will
probably leave you undisturbed in the possession of your error and by
such a manner you can seldom hope to recommend yourself in _pleasing_
your hearers or to persuade those whose concurrence you desire

which he has coupled with another i think
less properly
  "for want of modesty is want of sense"
if you ask why less properly i must repeat the lines
  "immodest words admit of no defense
   for want of modesty is want of sense"
now is not _want of sense_ (where a man is so unfortunate as to want
it) some apology for his _want of modesty_ and would not the lines
stand more justly thus
  "immodest words admit _but_ this defense
   that want of modesty is want of sense"

not likely to succeed one newspaper being in their judgment enough

[transcriber's note: transcription given at the end of the text]
he had some ingenious men among his friends who amus'd themselves by
writing little pieces for this paper which gain'd it credit and made
it more in demand and these gentlemen often visited us hearing their
conversations and their accounts of the approbation their papers were
received with i was excited to try my hand among them; but being
still a boy and suspecting that my brother would object to printing
anything of mine in his paper if he knew it to be mine i contrived to
disguise my hand and writing an anonymous paper i put it in at
night under the door of the printing-house it was found in the
morning and communicated to his writing friends when they call'd in
as usual they read it commented on it in my hearing and i had the
exquisite pleasure of finding it met with their approbation and that
in their different guesses at the author none were named but men of
some character among us for learning and ingenuity i suppose now that
i was rather lucky in my judges and that perhaps they were not really
so very good ones as i then esteem'd them
encourag'd however by this i wrote and conveyed in the same way to
the press several more papers which were equally approv'd; and i kept
my secret till my small fund of sense for such performances was pretty
well exhausted and then i discovered[] it when i began to be
considered a little more by my brother's acquaintance and in a manner
that did not quite please him as he thought probably with reason
that it tended to make me too vain and perhaps this might be one
occasion of the differences that we began to have about this time
though a brother he considered himself as my master and me as his
apprentice and accordingly expected the same services from me as he
would from another while i thought he demean'd me too much in some he
requir'd of me who from a brother expected more indulgence our
disputes were often brought before our father and i fancy i was
either generally in the right or else a better pleader because the
judgment was generally in my favor but my brother was passionate
and had often beaten me which i took extreamly amiss; and thinking
my apprenticeship very tedious i was continually wishing for some
opportunity of shortening it which at length offered in a manner
unexpected
    [] disclosed
[illustration: "i was employed to carry the papers thro' the streets
to the customers"]
one of the pieces in our newspaper on some political point which i
have now forgotten gave offense to the assembly he was taken up
censur'd and imprison'd for a month by the speaker's warrant i
suppose because he would not discover his author i too was taken up
and examin'd before the council; but tho' i did not give them any
satisfaction they contented themselves with admonishing me and
dismissed me considering me perhaps as an apprentice who was bound
to keep his master's secrets
during my brother's confinement which i resented a good deal
notwithstanding our private differences i had the management of the
paper; and i made bold to give our rulers some rubs in it which my
brother took very kindly while others began to consider me in an
unfavorable light as a young genius that had a turn for libeling and
satyr my brother's discharge was accompany'd with an order of the
house (a very odd one) that "_james franklin should no longer print
the paper called the new england courant_"
there was a consultation held in our printing-house among his friends
what he should do in this case some proposed to evade the order by
changing the name of the paper; but my brother seeing inconveniences
in that it was finally concluded on as a better way to let it be
printed for the future under the name of benjamin franklin; and to
avoid the censure of the assembly that might fall on him as still
printing it by his apprentice the contrivance was that my old
indenture should be return'd to me with a full discharge on the back
of it to be shown on occasion but to secure to him the benefit of my
service i was to sign new indentures for the remainder of the term
which were to be kept private a very flimsy scheme it was; however
it was immediately executed and the paper went on accordingly under
my name for several months
at length a fresh difference arising between my brother and me i
took upon me to assert my freedom presuming that he would not venture
to produce the new indentures it was not fair in me to take this
advantage and this i therefore reckon one of the first errata of my
life; but the unfairness of it weighed little with me when under the
impressions of resentment for the blows his passion too often urged
him to bestow upon me though he was otherwise not an ill-natur'd man:
perhaps i was too saucy and provoking
when he found i would leave him he took care to prevent my getting
employment in any other printing-house of the town by going round and
speaking to every master who accordingly refus'd to give me work i
then thought of going to new york as the nearest place where there
was a printer; and i was rather inclin'd to leave boston when i
reflected that i had already made myself a little obnoxious to the
governing party and from the arbitrary proceedings of the assembly
in my brother's case it was likely i might if i stay'd soon bring
myself into scrapes; and farther that my indiscreet disputations
about religion began to make me pointed at with horror by good people
as an infidel or atheist i determin'd on the point but my father now
siding with my brother i was sensible that if i attempted to go
openly means would be used to prevent me my friend collins
therefore undertook to manage a little for me he agreed with the
captain of a new york sloop for my passage under the notion of my
being a young acquaintance of his so i sold some of my books to raise
a little money was taken on board privately and as we had a fair
wind in three days i found myself in new york near  miles from
home a boy of but  without the least recommendation to or
knowledge of any person in the place and with very little money in
my pocket

arrival in philadelphia
my inclinations for the sea were by this time worne out or i might
now have gratify'd them but having a trade and supposing myself a
pretty good workman i offer'd my service to the printer in the place
old mr william bradford who had been the first printer in
pennsylvania but removed from thence upon the quarrel of george
keith he could give me no employment having little to do and help
enough already; but says he "my son at philadelphia has lately lost
his principal hand aquilla rose by death; if you go thither i
believe he may employ you" philadelphia was a hundred miles further;
i set out however in a boat for amboy leaving my chest and things
to follow me round by sea
in crossing the bay we met with a squall that tore our rotten sails
to pieces prevented our getting into the kill[] and drove us upon
long island in our way a drunken dutchman who was a passenger too
fell overboard; when he was sinking i reached through the water to
his shock pate and drew him up so that we got him in again his
ducking sobered him a little and he went to sleep taking first out
of his pocket a book which he desir'd i would dry for him it proved
to be my old favorite author bunyan's pilgrim's progress in dutch
finely printed on good paper with copper cuts a dress better than i
had ever seen it wear in its own language i have since found that it
has been translated into most of the languages of europe and suppose
it has been more generally read than any other book except perhaps
the bible honest john was the first that i know of who mix'd
narration and dialogue; a method of writing very engaging to the
reader who in the most interesting parts finds himself as it were
brought into the company and present at the discourse de foe in his
cruso his moll flanders religious courtship family instructor and
other pieces has imitated it with success; and richardson[] has done

when we drew near the island we found it was at a place where there
could be no landing there being a great surff on the stony beach so
we dropt anchor and swung round towards the shore some people came
down to the water edge and hallow'd to us as we did to them; but the
wind was so high and the surff so loud that we could not hear so as
to understand each other there were canoes on the shore and we made
signs and hallow'd that they should fetch us; but they either did not
understand us or thought it impracticable so they went away and
night coming on we had no remedy but to wait till the wind should
abate; and in the meantime the boatman and i concluded to sleep if
we could; and so crowded into the scuttle with the dutchman who was
still wet and the spray beating over the head of our boat leak'd
thro' to us so that we were soon almost as wet as he in this manner
we lay all night with very little rest; but the wind abating the
next day we made a shift to reach amboy before night having been
thirty hours on the water without victuals or any drink but a bottle
of filthy rum and the water we sail'd on being salt
in the evening i found myself very feverish and went in to bed; but
having read somewhere that cold water drank plentifully was good for a
fever i follow'd the prescription sweat plentifully most of the
night my fever left me and in the morning crossing the ferry i
proceeded on my journey on foot having fifty miles to burlington
where i was told i should find boats that would carry me the rest of
the way to philadelphia
[illustration: it rained very hard all the day]
it rained very hard all the day; i was thoroughly soak'd and by noon
a good deal tired; so i stopt at a poor inn where i staid all night
beginning now to wish that i had never left home i cut so miserable a
figure too that i found by the questions ask'd me i was suspected
to be some runaway servant and in danger of being taken up on that
suspicion however i proceeded the next day and got in the evening
to an inn within eight or ten miles of burlington kept by one dr
brown he entered into conversation with me while i took some
refreshment and finding i had read a little became very sociable
and friendly our acquaintance continu'd as long as he liv'd he had
been i imagine an itinerant doctor for there was no town in
england or country in europe of which he could not give a very
particular account he had some letters and was ingenious but much
of an unbeliever and wickedly undertook some years after to
travesty the bible in doggrel verse as cotton had done virgil by
this means he set many of the facts in a very ridiculous light and
might have hurt weak minds if his work had been published; but it
never was
at his house i lay that night and the next morning reach'd
burlington but had the mortification to find that the regular boats
were gone a little before my coming and no other expected to go
before tuesday this being saturday; wherefore i returned to an old
woman in the town of whom i had bought gingerbread to eat on the
water and ask'd her advice she invited me to lodge at her house till
a passage by water should offer; and being tired with my foot
traveling i accepted the invitation she understanding i was a
printer would have had me stay at that town and follow my business
being ignorant of the stock necessary to begin with she was very
hospitable gave me a dinner of ox-cheek with great good will
accepting only of a pot of ale in return; and i thought myself fixed
till tuesday should come however walking in the evening by the side
of the river a boat came by which i found was going towards
philadelphia with several people in her they took me in and as
there was no wind we row'd all the way; and about midnight not
having yet seen the city some of the company were confident we must
have passed it and would row no farther; the others knew not where we
were; so we put toward the shore got into a creek landed near an old
fence with the rails of which we made a fire the night being cold
in october and there we remained till daylight then one of the
company knew the place to be cooper's creek a little above
philadelphia which we saw as soon as we got out of the creek and
arriv'd there about eight or nine o'clock on the sunday morning and
landed at the market-street wharf
i have been the more particular in this description of my journey and
shall be so of my first entry into that city that you may in your
mind compare such unlikely beginnings with the figure i have since
made there i was in my working dress my best clothes being to come
round by sea i was dirty from my journey; my pockets were stuff'd out
with shirts and stockings and i knew no soul nor where to look for
lodging i was fatigued with traveling rowing and want of rest i
was very hungry; and my whole stock of cash consisted of a dutch
dollar and about a shilling in copper the latter i gave the people
of the boat for my passage who at first refus'd it on account of my
rowing; but i insisted on their taking it a man being sometimes more
generous when he has but a little money than when he has plenty
perhaps thro' fear of being thought to have but little
then i walked up the street gazing about till near the market-house i
met a boy with bread i had made many a meal on bread and inquiring
where he got it i went immediately to the baker's he directed me to
in second-street and ask'd for bisket intending such as we had in
boston; but they it seems were not made in philadelphia then i
asked for a three-penny loaf and was told they had none such so not

data science is an interdisciplinary academic field [] that uses statistics scientific computing scientific methods processes algorithms and systems to extract or extrapolate knowledge and insights from noisy structured and unstructured data[]
data science also integrates domain knowledge from the underlying application domain (eg natural sciences information technology and medicine)[] data science is multifaceted and can be described as a science a research paradigm a research method a discipline a workflow and a profession[]
data science is a "concept to unify statistics data analysis informatics and their related methods" to "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data[] it uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics statistics computer science information science and domain knowledge[] however data science is different from computer science and information science turing award winner jim gray imagined data science as a "fourth paradigm" of science (empirical theoretical computational and now data-driven) and asserted that "everything about science is changing because of the impact of information technology" and the data deluge[][]
a data scientist is a professional who creates programming code and combines it with statistical knowledge to create insights from data[]
foundations
data science is an interdisciplinary field[] focused on extracting knowledge from typically large data sets and applying the knowledge and insights from that data to solve problems in a wide range of application domains the field encompasses preparing data for analysis formulating data science problems analyzing data developing data-driven solutions and presenting findings to inform high-level decisions in a broad range of application domains as such it incorporates skills from computer science statistics information science mathematics data visualization information visualization data sonification data integration graphic design complex systems communication and business[][] statistician nathan yau drawing on ben fry also links data science to human–computer interaction: users should be able to intuitively control and explore data[][] in  the american statistical association identified database management statistics and machine learning and distributed and parallel systems as the three emerging foundational professional communities[]
relationship to statistics
many statisticians including nate silver have argued that data science is not a new field but rather another name for statistics[] others argue that data science is distinct from statistics because it focuses on problems and techniques unique to digital data[] vasant dhar writes that statistics emphasizes quantitative data and description in contrast data science deals with quantitative and qualitative data (eg from images text sensors transactions customer information etc) and emphasizes prediction and action[] andrew gelman of columbia university has described statistics as a non-essential part of data science[]
stanford professor david donoho writes that data science is not distinguished from statistics by the size of datasets or use of computing and that many graduate programs misleadingly advertise their analytics and statistics training as the essence of a data-science program he describes data science as an applied field growing out of traditional statistics[]
etymology
early usage
in  john tukey described a field he called "data analysis" which resembles modern data science[] in  in a lecture given to the chinese academy of sciences in beijing c f jeff wu used the term "data science" for the first time as an alternative name for statistics[] later attendees at a  statistics symposium at the university of montpellier  ii acknowledged the emergence of a new discipline focused on data of various origins and forms combining established concepts and principles of statistics and data analysis with computing[][]
the term "data science" has been traced back to  when peter naur proposed it as an alternative name to computer science[] in  the international federation of classification societies became the first conference to specifically feature data science as a topic[] however the definition was still in flux after the  lecture at the chinese academy of sciences in beijing in  c f jeff wu again suggested that statistics should be renamed data science he reasoned that a new name would help statistics shed inaccurate stereotypes such as being synonymous with accounting or limited to describing data[] in  hayashi chikio argued for data science as a new interdisciplinary concept with three aspects: data design collection and analysis[]
during the s popular terms for the process of finding patterns in datasets (which were increasingly large) included "knowledge discovery" and "data mining"[][]
modern usage
in  technologists thomas h davenport and dj patil declared "data scientist: the sexiest job of the st century"[] a catchphrase that was picked up even by major-city newspapers like the new york times[] and the boston globe[] a decade later they reaffirmed it stating that "the job is more in demand than ever with employers"[]
the modern conception of data science as an independent discipline is sometimes attributed to william s cleveland[] in a  paper he advocated an expansion of statistics beyond theory into technical areas; because this would significantly change the field it warranted a new name[] "data science" became more widely used in the next few years: in  the committee on data for science and technology launched the data science journal in  columbia university launched the journal of data science[] in  the american statistical association's section on statistical learning and data mining changed its name to the section on statistical learning and data science reflecting the ascendant popularity of data science[]
the professional title of "data scientist" has been attributed to dj patil and jeff hammerbacher in [] though it was used by the national science board in their  report "long-lived digital data collections: enabling research and education in the st century" it referred broadly to any key role in managing a digital data collection[]
there is still no consensus on the definition of data science and it is considered by some to be a buzzword[] big data is a related marketing term[] data scientists are responsible for breaking down big data into usable information and creating software and algorithms that help companies and organizations determine optimal operations[]
data science and data analysis
data science and data analysis are both important disciplines in the field of data management and analysis but they differ in several key ways while both fields involve working with data data science is more of an interdisciplinary field that involves the application of statistical computational and machine learning methods to extract insights from data and make predictions while data analysis is more focused on the examination and interpretation of data to identify patterns and trends[][]
data analysis typically involves working with smaller structured datasets to answer specific questions or solve specific problems this can involve tasks such as data cleaning data visualization and exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data and develop hypotheses about relationships between variables data analysts typically use statistical methods to test these hypotheses and draw conclusions from the data for example a data analyst might analyze sales data to identify trends in customer behavior and make recommendations for marketing strategies[]
data science on the other hand is a more complex and iterative process that involves working with larger more complex datasets that often require advanced computational and statistical methods to analyze data scientists often work with unstructured data such as text or images and use machine learning algorithms to build predictive models and make data-driven decisions in addition to statistical analysis data science often involves tasks such as data preprocessing feature engineering and model selection for instance a data scientist might develop a recommendation system for an e-commerce platform by analyzing user behavior patterns and using machine learning algorithms to predict user preferences[][]
while data analysis focuses on extracting insights from existing data data science goes beyond that by incorporating the development and implementation of predictive models to make informed decisions data scientists are often responsible for collecting and cleaning data selecting appropriate analytical techniques and deploying models in real-world scenarios they work at the intersection of mathematics computer science and domain expertise to solve complex problems and uncover hidden patterns in large datasets[]
despite these differences data science and data analysis are closely related fields and often require similar skill sets both fields require a solid foundation in statistics programming and data visualization as well as the ability to communicate findings effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences moreover both fields benefit from critical thinking and domain knowledge as understanding the context and nuances of the data is essential for accurate analysis and modeling[][]
in summary data analysis and data science are distinct yet interconnected disciplines within the broader field of data management and analysis data analysis focuses on extracting insights and drawing conclusions from structured data while data science involves a more comprehensive approach that combines statistical analysis computational methods and machine learning to extract insights build predictive models and drive data-driven decision-making both fields play vital roles in leveraging the power of data to understand patterns make informed decisions and solve complex problems across various domains
the universe is all of space and time[a] and their contents[] including planets stars galaxies and all other forms of matter and energy the big bang theory is the prevailing cosmological description of the development of the universe according to this theory space and time emerged together ± billion years ago[] and the universe has been expanding ever since the big bang while the spatial size of the entire universe is unknown[] it is possible to measure the size of the observable universe which is approximately  billion light-years in diameter at the present day
some of the earliest cosmological models of the universe were developed by ancient greek and indian philosophers and were geocentric placing earth at the center[][] over the centuries more precise astronomical observations led nicolaus copernicus to develop the heliocentric model with the sun at the center of the solar system in developing the law of universal gravitation isaac newton built upon copernicus's work as well as johannes kepler's laws of planetary motion and observations by tycho brahe
further observational improvements led to the realization that the sun is one of a few hundred billion stars in the milky way which is one of a few hundred billion galaxies in the observable universe many of the stars in a galaxy have planets at the largest scale galaxies are distributed uniformly and the same in all directions meaning that the universe has neither an edge nor a center at smaller scales galaxies are distributed in clusters and superclusters which form immense filaments and voids in space creating a vast foam-like structure[] discoveries in the early th century have suggested that the universe had a beginning and has been expanding since then[]
according to the big bang theory the energy and matter initially present have become less dense as the universe expanded after an initial accelerated expansion called the inflationary epoch at around − seconds and the separation of the four known fundamental forces the universe gradually cooled and continued to expand allowing the first subatomic particles and simple atoms to form dark matter gradually gathered forming a foam-like structure of filaments and voids under the influence of gravity giant clouds of hydrogen and helium were gradually drawn to the places where dark matter was most dense forming the first galaxies stars and everything else seen today
from studying the movement of galaxies it has been discovered that the universe contains much more matter than is accounted for by visible objects; stars galaxies nebulas and interstellar gas this unseen matter is known as dark matter[] (dark means that there is a wide range of strong indirect evidence that it exists but we have not yet detected it directly) the λcdm model is the most widely accepted model of the universe it suggests that about ± of the mass and energy in the universe is dark energy which is responsible for the acceleration of the expansion of the universe and about ± is dark matter[] ordinary ('baryonic') matter is therefore only ± of the physical universe[] stars planets and visible gas clouds only form about  of the ordinary matter[]
there are many competing hypotheses about the ultimate fate of the universe and about what if anything preceded the big bang while other physicists and philosophers refuse to speculate doubting that information about prior states will ever be accessible some physicists have suggested various multiverse hypotheses in which our universe might be one among many universes that likewise exist[][][]

the physical universe is defined as all of space and time[a] (collectively referred to as spacetime) and their contents[] such contents comprise all of energy in its various forms including electromagnetic radiation and matter and therefore planets moons stars galaxies and the contents of intergalactic space[][][] the universe also includes the physical laws that influence energy and matter such as conservation laws classical mechanics and relativity[]
the universe is often defined as "the totality of existence" or everything that exists everything that has existed and everything that will exist[] in fact some philosophers and scientists support the inclusion of ideas and abstract concepts—such as mathematics and logic—in the definition of the universe[][][] the word universe may also refer to concepts such as the cosmos the world and nature[][]
etymology
the word universe derives from the old french word univers which in turn derives from the latin word universus meaning 'combined into one'[] the latin word 'universum' was used by cicero and later latin authors in many of the same senses as the modern english word is used[]
the prevailing model for the evolution of the universe is the big bang theory[][] the big bang model states that the earliest state of the universe was an extremely hot and dense one and that the universe subsequently expanded and cooled the model is based on general relativity and on simplifying assumptions such as the homogeneity and isotropy of space a version of the model with a cosmological constant (lambda) and cold dark matter known as the lambda-cdm model is the simplest model that provides a reasonably good account of various observations about the universe the big bang model accounts for observations such as the correlation of distance and redshift of galaxies the ratio of the number of hydrogen to helium atoms and the microwave radiation background
in this schematic diagram time passes from left to right with the universe represented by a disk-shaped "slice" at any given time time and size are not to scale to make the early stages visible the time to the afterglow stage (really the first ) is stretched and the subsequent expansion (really by  times to the present) is largely suppressed
the initial hot dense state is called the planck epoch a brief period extending from time zero to one planck time unit of approximately − seconds during the planck epoch all types of matter and all types of energy were concentrated into a dense state and gravity—currently the weakest by far of the four known forces—is believed to have been as strong as the other fundamental forces and all the forces may have been unified the physics controlling this very early period (including quantum gravity in the planck epoch) is not understood so we cannot say what if anything happened before time zero since the planck epoch the universe has been expanding to its present scale with a very short but intense period of cosmic inflation speculated to have occurred within the first − seconds[] this initial period of inflation would explain why space appears to be very flat and is uniform on scales much larger than light could otherwise travel since the start of the universe
within the first fraction of a second of the universe's existence the four fundamental forces had separated as the universe continued to cool down from its inconceivably hot state various types of subatomic particles were able to form in short periods of time known as the quark epoch the hadron epoch and the lepton epoch together these epochs encompassed less than  seconds of time following the big bang these elementary particles associated stably into ever larger combinations including stable protons and neutrons which then formed more complex atomic nuclei through nuclear fusion this process known as big bang nucleosynthesis only lasted for about  minutes and ended about  minutes after the big bang so only the fastest and simplest reactions occurred about  of the protons and all the neutrons in the universe by mass were converted to helium with small amounts of deuterium (a form of hydrogen) and traces of lithium any other element was only formed in very tiny quantities the other  of the protons remained unaffected as hydrogen nuclei[][]: – 
after nucleosynthesis ended the universe entered a period known as the photon epoch during this period the universe was still far too hot for matter to form neutral atoms so it contained a hot dense foggy plasma of negatively charged electrons neutral neutrinos and positive nuclei after about  years the universe had cooled enough that electrons and nuclei could form the first stable atoms this is known as recombination for historical reasons; in fact electrons and nuclei were combining for the first time unlike plasma neutral atoms are transparent to many wavelengths of light so for the first time the universe also became transparent the photons released ("decoupled") when these atoms formed can still be seen today; they form the cosmic microwave background (cmb)[]: – 
as the universe expands the energy density of electromagnetic radiation decreases more quickly than does that of matter because the energy of each photon decreases as it is cosmologically redshifted at around  years the energy density of matter became larger than that of photons and neutrinos and began to dominate the large scale behavior of the universe this marked the end of the radiation-dominated era and the start of the matter-dominated era[]:  
in the earliest stages of the universe tiny fluctuations within the universe's density led to concentrations of dark matter gradually forming ordinary matter attracted to these by gravity formed large gas clouds and eventually stars and galaxies where the dark matter was most dense and voids where it was least dense after around – million years[]:   the first stars formed known as population iii stars these were probably very massive luminous non metallic and short-lived they were responsible for the gradual reionization of the universe between about – million years and  billion years and also for seeding the universe with elements heavier than helium through stellar nucleosynthesis[] the universe also contains a mysterious energy—possibly a scalar field—called dark energy the density of which does not change over time after about  billion years the universe had expanded sufficiently so that the density of matter was less than the density of dark energy marking the beginning of the present dark-energy-dominated era[] in this era the expansion of the universe is accelerating due to dark energy
physical properties
main articles: observable universe age of the universe and metric expansion of space
of the four fundamental interactions gravitation is the dominant at astronomical length scales gravity's effects are cumulative; by contrast the effects of positive and negative charges tend to cancel one another making electromagnetism relatively insignificant on astronomical length scales the remaining two interactions the weak and strong nuclear forces decline very rapidly with distance; their effects are confined mainly to sub-atomic length scales[]:  
the universe appears to have much more matter than antimatter an asymmetry possibly related to the cp violation[] this imbalance between matter and antimatter is partially responsible for the existence of all matter existing today since matter and antimatter if equally produced at the big bang would have completely annihilated each other and left only photons as a result of their interaction[] the universe also appears to have neither net momentum nor angular momentum which follows accepted physical laws if the universe is finite these laws are gauss's law and the non-divergence of the stress–energy–momentum pseudotensor[]

television signals broadcast from earth will never reach the edges of this image
according to the general theory of relativity far regions of space may never interact with ours even in the lifetime of the universe due to the finite speed of light and the ongoing expansion of space for example radio messages sent from earth may never reach some regions of space even if the universe were to exist forever: space may expand faster than light can traverse it[]
the spatial region that can be observed with telescopes is called the observable universe which depends on the location of the observer the proper distance—the distance as would be measured at a specific time including the present—between earth and the edge of the observable universe is  billion light-years[] ( billion parsecs) making the diameter of the observable universe about  billion light-years ( billion parsecs)[] the distance the light from the edge of the observable universe has travelled is very close to the age of the universe times the speed of light  billion light-years (× pc) but this does not represent the distance at any given time because the edge of the observable universe and the earth have since moved further apart[] for comparison the diameter of a typical galaxy is  light-years ( parsecs) and the typical distance between two neighboring galaxies is  million light-years ( kiloparsecs)[] as an example the milky way is roughly – light-years in diameter[][] and the nearest sister galaxy to the milky way the andromeda galaxy is located roughly  million light-years away[]
because humans cannot observe space beyond the edge of the observable universe it is unknown whether the size of the universe in its totality is finite or infinite[][][] estimates suggest that the whole universe if finite must be more than  times larger than a hubble sphere[] some disputed[] estimates for the total size of the universe if finite reach as high as

astronomers have discovered stars in the milky way galaxy that are almost  billion years old
over time the universe and its contents have evolved for example the relative population of quasars and galaxies has changed[] and the universe has expanded this expansion is inferred from the observation that the light from distant galaxies has been redshifted which implies that the galaxies are receding from us analyses of type ia supernovae indicate that the expansion is accelerating[][]
the more matter there is in the universe the stronger the mutual gravitational pull of the matter if the universe were too dense then it would re-collapse into a gravitational singularity however if the universe contained too little matter then the self-gravity would be too weak for astronomical structures like galaxies or planets to form since the big bang the universe has expanded monotonically perhaps unsurprisingly our universe has just the right mass–energy density equivalent to about  protons per cubic metre which has allowed it to expand for the last  billion years giving time to form the universe as observed today[][]
there are dynamical forces acting on the particles in the universe which affect the expansion rate before  it was expected that the expansion rate would be decreasing as time went on due to the influence of gravitational interactions in the universe; and thus there is an additional observable quantity in the universe called the deceleration parameter which most cosmologists expected to be positive and related to the matter density of the universe in  the deceleration parameter was measured by two different groups to be negative approximately − which technically implies that the second derivative of the cosmic scale factor 
modern physics regards events as being organized into spacetime[] this idea originated with the special theory of relativity which predicts that if one observer sees two events happening in different places at the same time a second observer who is moving relative to the first will see those events happening at different times[]: –  the two observers will disagree on the time the square root of the absolute value of this quantity is called the interval between the two events the interval expresses how widely separated events are not just in space or in time but in the combined setting of spacetime[]:   []
the special theory of relativity cannot account for gravity its successor the general theory of relativity explains gravity by recognizing that spacetime is not fixed but instead dynamical in general relativity gravitational force is reimagined as curvature of spacetime a curved path like an orbit is not the result of a force deflecting a body from an ideal straight-line path but rather the body's attempt to fall freely through a background that is itself curved by the presence of other masses a remark by john archibald wheeler that has become proverbial among physicists summarizes the theory: "spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve"[][] and therefore there is no point in considering one without the other[] (the newtonian theory of gravity is a good approximation to the predictions of general relativity when gravitational effects are weak and objects are moving slowly compared to the speed of light[]:  []) the relation between matter distribution and spacetime curvature is given by the einstein field equations which require tensor calculus to express[]:  [] the solutions to these equations include not only the spacetime of special relativity minkowski spacetime but also schwarzschild spacetimes which describe black holes; flrw spacetime which describes an expanding universe; and more
the universe appears to be a smooth spacetime continuum consisting of three spatial dimensions and one temporal (time) dimension therefore an event in the spacetime of the physical universe can therefore be identified by a set of four coordinates: (x y z t) on average space is observed to be very nearly flat (with a curvature close to zero) meaning that euclidean geometry is empirically true with high accuracy throughout most of the universe[] spacetime also appears to have a simply connected topology in analogy with a sphere at least on the length scale of the observable universe however present observations cannot exclude the possibilities that the universe has more dimensions (which is postulated by theories such as the string theory) and that its spacetime may have a multiply connected global topology in analogy with the cylindrical or toroidal topologies of two-dimensional spaces[][]
shape
main article: shape of the universe
the three possible options for the shape of the universe
general relativity describes how spacetime is curved and bent by mass and energy (gravity) the topology or geometry of the universe includes both local geometry in the observable universe and global geometry cosmologists often work with a given space-like slice of spacetime called the comoving coordinates the section of spacetime which can be observed is the backward light cone which delimits the cosmological horizon the cosmological horizon (also called the particle horizon or the light horizon) is the maximum distance from which particles can have traveled to the observer in the age of the universe this horizon represents the boundary between the observable and the unobservable regions of the universe[][] the existence properties and significance of a cosmological horizon depend on the particular cosmological model
an important parameter determining the future evolution of the universe theory is the density parameter omega (ω) defined as the average matter density of the universe divided by a critical value of that density this selects one of three possible geometries depending on whether ω is equal to less than or greater than  these are called respectively the flat open and closed universes[]
observations including the cosmic background explorer (cobe) wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (wmap) and planck maps of the cmb suggest that the universe is infinite in extent with a finite age as described by the friedmann–lemaître–robertson–walker (flrw) models[][][][] these flrw models thus support inflationary models and the standard model of cosmology describing a flat homogeneous universe presently dominated by dark matter and dark energy[][]
support of life
main article: fine-tuned universe
the fine-tuned universe hypothesis is the proposition that the conditions that allow the existence of observable life in the universe can only occur when certain universal fundamental physical constants lie within a very narrow range of values according to this hypothesis if any of several fundamental constants were only slightly different the universe would have been unlikely to be conducive to the establishment and development of matter astronomical structures elemental diversity or life as it is understood whether this is true and whether that question is even logically meaningful to ask are subjects of much debate[] the proposition is discussed among philosophers scientists theologians and proponents of creationism[]

the universe is composed almost completely of dark energy dark matter and ordinary matter other contents are electromagnetic radiation (estimated to constitute from  to close to  of the total mass–energy of the universe) and antimatter[][][]
the proportions of all types of matter and energy have changed over the history of the universe[] the total amount of electromagnetic radiation generated within the universe has decreased by / in the past  billion years[][] today ordinary matter which includes atoms stars galaxies and life accounts for only  of the contents of the universe[] the present overall density of this type of matter is very low roughly  × − grams per cubic centimetre corresponding to a density of the order of only one proton for every four cubic metres of volume[] the nature of both dark energy and dark matter is unknown dark matter a mysterious form of matter that has not yet been identified accounts for  of the cosmic contents dark energy which is the energy of empty space and is causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate accounts for the remaining  of the contents[][][]

matter dark matter and dark energy are distributed homogeneously throughout the universe over length scales longer than  million light-years or so[] however over shorter length-scales matter tends to clump hierarchically; many atoms are condensed into stars most stars into galaxies most galaxies into clusters superclusters and finally large-scale galactic filaments the observable universe contains as many as  billion galaxies[][] and overall as many as an estimated × stars[][] (more stars than all the grains of sand on planet earth)[] typical galaxies range from dwarfs with as few as ten million[] () stars up to giants with one trillion[] () stars between the larger structures are voids which are typically – mpc ( million– million ly) in diameter the milky way is in the local group of galaxies which in turn is in the laniakea supercluster[] this supercluster spans over  million light-years while the local group spans over  million light-years[] the universe also has vast regions of relative emptiness; the largest known void measures  billion ly ( mpc) across[]

the observable universe is isotropic on scales significantly larger than superclusters meaning that the statistical properties of the universe are the same in all directions as observed from earth the universe is bathed in highly isotropic microwave radiation that corresponds to a thermal equilibrium blackbody spectrum of roughly  kelvins[] the hypothesis that the large-scale universe is homogeneous and isotropic is known as the cosmological principle[] a universe that is both homogeneous and isotropic looks the same from all vantage points[] and has no center[]
dark energy
main article: dark energy
an explanation for why the expansion of the universe is accelerating remains elusive it is often attributed to "dark energy" an unknown form of energy that is hypothesized to permeate space[] on a mass–energy equivalence basis the density of dark energy (~  × − g/cm) is much less than the density of ordinary matter or dark matter within galaxies however in the present dark-energy era it dominates the mass–energy of the universe because it is uniform across space[][]
two proposed forms for dark energy are the cosmological constant a constant energy density filling space homogeneously[] and scalar fields such as quintessence or moduli dynamic quantities whose energy density can vary in time and space contributions from scalar fields that are constant in space are usually also included in the cosmological constant the cosmological constant can be formulated to be equivalent to vacuum energy scalar fields having only a slight amount of spatial inhomogeneity would be difficult to distinguish from a cosmological constant
dark matter
main article: dark matter
dark matter is a hypothetical kind of matter that is invisible to the entire electromagnetic spectrum but which accounts for most of the matter in the universe the existence and properties of dark matter are inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter radiation and the large-scale structure of the universe other than neutrinos a form of hot dark matter dark matter has not been detected directly making it one of the greatest mysteries in modern astrophysics dark matter neither emits nor absorbs light or any other electromagnetic radiation at any significant level dark matter is estimated to constitute  of the total mass–energy and  of the total matter in the universe[][]
ordinary matter
main article: matter
the remaining  of the mass–energy of the universe is ordinary matter that is atoms ions electrons and the objects they form this matter includes stars which produce nearly all of the light we see from galaxies as well as interstellar gas in the interstellar and intergalactic media planets and all the objects from everyday life that we can bump into touch or squeeze[] as a matter of fact the great majority of ordinary matter in the universe is unseen since visible stars and gas inside galaxies and clusters account for less than  per cent of the ordinary matter contribution to the mass–energy density of the universe[][][]
ordinary matter commonly exists in four states (or phases): solid liquid gas and plasma[] however advances in experimental techniques have revealed other previously theoretical phases such as bose–einstein condensates and fermionic condensates[][]
ordinary matter is composed of two types of elementary particles: quarks and leptons[] for example the proton is formed of two up quarks and one down quark; the neutron is formed of two down quarks and one up quark; and the electron is a kind of lepton an atom consists of an atomic nucleus made up of protons and neutrons (both of which are baryons) and electrons that orbit the nucleus[]:   because most of the mass of an atom is concentrated in its nucleus which is made up of baryons astronomers often use the term baryonic matter to describe ordinary matter although a small fraction of this "baryonic matter" is electrons
soon after the big bang primordial protons and neutrons formed from the quark–gluon plasma of the early universe as it cooled below two trillion degrees a few minutes later in a process known as big bang nucleosynthesis nuclei formed from the primordial protons and neutrons this nucleosynthesis formed lighter elements those with small atomic numbers up to lithium and beryllium but the abundance of heavier elements dropped off sharply with increasing atomic number some boron may have been formed at this time but the next heavier element carbon was not formed in significant amounts big bang nucleosynthesis shut down after about  minutes due to the rapid drop in temperature and density of the expanding universe subsequent formation of heavier elements resulted from stellar nucleosynthesis and supernova nucleosynthesis[]

main article: particle physics
ordinary matter and the forces that act on matter can be described in terms of elementary particles[] these particles are sometimes described as being fundamental since they have an unknown substructure and it is unknown whether or not they are composed of smaller and even more fundamental particles[][] in most contemporary models they are thought of as points in space[] all elementary particles are currently best explained by quantum mechanics and exhibit wave–particle duality: their behavior has both particle-like and wave-like aspects with different features dominating under different circumstances[] of central importance is the standard model a theory that is concerned with electromagnetic interactions and the weak and strong nuclear interactions[] the standard model is supported by the experimental confirmation of the existence of particles that compose matter: quarks and leptons and their corresponding "antimatter" duals as well as the force particles that mediate interactions: the photon the w and z bosons and the gluon[] the standard model predicted the existence of the recently discovered higgs boson a particle that is a manifestation of a field within the universe that can endow particles with mass[][] because of its success in explaining a wide variety of experimental results the standard model is sometimes regarded as a "theory of almost everything"[] the standard model does not however accommodate gravity a true force–particle "theory of everything" has not been attained[]
hadrons
main article: hadron
a hadron is a composite particle made of quarks held together by the strong force hadrons are categorized into two families: baryons (such as protons and neutrons) made of three quarks and mesons (such as pions) made of one quark and one antiquark of the hadrons protons are stable and neutrons bound within atomic nuclei are stable other hadrons are unstable under ordinary conditions and are thus insignificant constituents of the modern universe[]: –  from approximately − seconds after the big bang during a period known as the hadron epoch the temperature of the universe had fallen sufficiently to allow quarks to bind together into hadrons and the mass of the universe was dominated by hadrons initially the temperature was high enough to allow the formation of hadron–anti-hadron pairs which kept matter and antimatter in thermal equilibrium however as the temperature of the universe continued to fall hadron–anti-hadron pairs were no longer produced most of the hadrons and anti-hadrons were then eliminated in particle–antiparticle annihilation reactions leaving a small residual of hadrons by the time the universe was about one second old[]: – 
leptons
main article: lepton
a lepton is an elementary half-integer spin particle that does not undergo strong interactions but is subject to the pauli exclusion principle; no two leptons of the same species can be in exactly the same state at the same time[] two main classes of leptons exist: charged leptons (also known as the electron-like leptons) and neutral leptons (better known as neutrinos) electrons are stable and the most common charged lepton in the universe whereas muons and taus are unstable particles that quickly decay after being produced in high energy collisions such as those involving cosmic rays or carried out in particle accelerators[][] charged leptons can combine with other particles to form various composite particles such as atoms and positronium the electron governs nearly all of chemistry as it is found in atoms and is directly tied to all chemical properties neutrinos rarely interact with anything and are consequently rarely observed neutrinos stream throughout the universe but rarely interact with normal matter[]
the lepton epoch was the period in the evolution of the early universe in which the leptons dominated the mass of the universe it started roughly  second after the big bang after the majority of hadrons and anti-hadrons annihilated each other at the end of the hadron epoch during the lepton epoch the temperature of the universe was still high enough to create lepton–anti-lepton pairs so leptons and anti-leptons were in thermal equilibrium approximately  seconds after the big bang the temperature of the universe had fallen to the point where lepton–anti-lepton pairs were no longer created[] most leptons and anti-leptons were then eliminated in annihilation reactions leaving a small residue of leptons the mass of the universe was then dominated by photons as it entered the following photon epoch[][]
photons
main article: photon epoch
see also: photino
a photon is the quantum of light and all other forms of electromagnetic radiation it is the carrier for the electromagnetic force the effects of this force are easily observable at the microscopic and at the macroscopic level because the photon has zero rest mass; this allows long distance interactions[]:  
the photon epoch started after most leptons and anti-leptons were annihilated at the end of the lepton epoch about  seconds after the big bang atomic nuclei were created in the process of nucleosynthesis which occurred during the first few minutes of the photon epoch for the remainder of the photon epoch the universe contained a hot dense plasma of nuclei electrons and photons about  years after the big bang the temperature of the universe fell to the point where nuclei could combine with electrons to create neutral atoms as a result photons no longer interacted frequently with matter and the universe became transparent the highly redshifted photons from this period form the cosmic microwave background tiny variations in temperature and density detectable in the cmb were the early "seeds" from which all subsequent structure formation took place[]: –

cosmological models
model of the universe based on general relativity
main article: solutions of the einstein field equations
see also: big bang and ultimate fate of the universe
general relativity is the geometric theory of gravitation published by albert einstein in  and the current description of gravitation in modern physics it is the basis of current cosmological models of the universe general relativity generalizes special relativity and newton's law of universal gravitation providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and time or spacetime in particular the curvature of spacetime is directly related to the energy and momentum of whatever matter and radiation are present the relation is specified by the einstein field equations a system of partial differential equations in general relativity the distribution of matter and energy determines the geometry of spacetime which in turn describes the acceleration of matter therefore solutions of the einstein field equations describe the evolution of the universe combined with measurements of the amount type and distribution of matter in the universe the equations of general relativity describe the evolution of the universe over time[]
with the assumption of the cosmological principle that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic everywhere a specific solution of the field equations that describes the universe is the metric tensor called the friedmann–lemaître–robertson–walker metric
where (r θ φ) correspond to a spherical coordinate system this metric has only two undetermined parameters an overall dimensionless length scale factor r describes the size scale of the universe as a function of time (an increase in r is the expansion of the universe)[] and a curvature index k describes the geometry the index k is defined so that it can take only one of three values:  corresponding to flat euclidean geometry;  corresponding to a space of positive curvature; or − corresponding to a space of positive or negative curvature[] the value of r as a function of time t depends upon k and the cosmological constant λ[] the cosmological constant represents the energy density of the vacuum of space and could be related to dark energy[] the equation describing how r varies with time is known as the friedmann equation after its inventor alexander friedmann[]
the solutions for r(t) depend on k and λ but some qualitative features of such solutions are general first and most importantly the length scale r of the universe can remain constant only if the universe is perfectly isotropic with positive curvature (k=) and has one precise value of density everywhere as first noted by albert einstein[] however this equilibrium is unstable: if the density were slightly different from the needed value at any place the difference would be amplified over time
second all solutions suggest that there was a gravitational singularity in the past when r went to zero and matter and energy were infinitely dense it may seem that this conclusion is uncertain because it is based on the questionable assumptions of perfect homogeneity and isotropy (the cosmological principle) and that only the gravitational interaction is significant however the penrose–hawking singularity theorems show that a singularity should exist for very general conditions hence according to einstein's field equations r grew rapidly from an unimaginably hot dense state that existed immediately following this singularity (when r had a small finite value); this is the essence of the big bang model of the universe understanding the singularity of the big bang likely requires a quantum theory of gravity which has not yet been formulated[]
third the curvature index k determines the sign of the curvature of constant-time spatial surfaces[] averaged over sufficiently large length scales (greater than about a billion light-years) if k= the curvature is positive and the universe has a finite volume[] a universe with positive curvature is often visualized as a three-dimensional sphere embedded in a four-dimensional space conversely if k is zero or negative the universe has an infinite volume[] it may seem counter-intuitive that an infinite and yet infinitely dense universe could be created in a single instant when r =  but exactly that is predicted mathematically when k is nonpositive and the cosmological principle is satisfied by analogy an infinite plane has zero curvature but infinite area whereas an infinite cylinder is finite in one direction and a torus is finite in both a toroidal universe could behave like a normal universe with periodic boundary conditions
the ultimate fate of the universe is still unknown because it depends critically on the curvature index k and the cosmological constant λ if the universe were sufficiently dense k would equal + meaning that its average curvature throughout is positive and the universe will eventually recollapse in a big crunch[] possibly starting a new universe in a big bounce conversely if the universe were insufficiently dense k would equal  or − and the universe would expand forever cooling off and eventually reaching the big freeze and the heat death of the universe[] modern data suggests that the expansion of the universe is accelerating; if this acceleration is sufficiently rapid the universe may eventually reach a big rip observationally the universe appears to be flat (k = ) with an overall density that is very close to the critical value between recollapse and eternal expansion[]
multiverse hypotheses
main articles: multiverse many-worlds interpretation and bubble universe theory
see also: eternal inflation
some speculative theories have proposed that our universe is but one of a set of disconnected universes collectively denoted as the multiverse challenging or enhancing more limited definitions of the universe[][] scientific multiverse models are distinct from concepts such as alternate planes of consciousness and simulated reality
max tegmark developed a four-part classification scheme for the different types of multiverses that scientists have suggested in response to various problems in physics an example of such multiverses is the one resulting from the chaotic inflation model of the early universe[] another is the multiverse resulting from the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics in this interpretation parallel worlds are generated in a manner similar to quantum superposition and decoherence with all states of the wave functions being realized in separate worlds effectively in the many-worlds interpretation the multiverse evolves as a universal wavefunction if the big bang that created our multiverse created an ensemble of multiverses the wave function of the ensemble would be entangled in this sense[] whether scientifically meaningful probabilities can be extracted from this picture has been and continues to be a topic of much debate and multiple versions of the many-worlds interpretation exist[][][] (the subject of the interpretation of quantum mechanics is in general marked by disagreement[][][])
the least controversial but still highly disputed category of multiverse in tegmark's scheme is level i the multiverses of this level are composed by distant spacetime events "in our own universe" tegmark and others[] have argued that if space is infinite or sufficiently large and uniform identical instances of the history of earth's entire hubble volume occur every so often simply by chance tegmark calculated that our nearest so-called doppelgänger is  metres away from us (a double exponential function larger than a googolplex)[][] however the arguments used are of speculative nature[] additionally it would be impossible to scientifically verify the existence of an identical hubble volume
it is possible to conceive of disconnected spacetimes each existing but unable to interact with one another[][] an easily visualized metaphor of this concept is a group of separate soap bubbles in which observers living on one soap bubble cannot interact with those on other soap bubbles even in principle[] according to one common terminology each "soap bubble" of spacetime is denoted as a universe whereas humans' particular spacetime is denoted as the universe[] just as humans call earth's moon the moon the entire collection of these separate spacetimes is denoted as the multiverse[] with this terminology different universes are not causally connected to each other[] in principle the other unconnected universes may have different dimensionalities and topologies of spacetime different forms of matter and energy and different physical laws and physical constants although such possibilities are purely speculative[] others consider each of several bubbles created as part of chaotic inflation to be separate universes though in this model these universes all share a causal origin[]

historically there have been many ideas of the cosmos (cosmologies) and its origin (cosmogonies) theories of an impersonal universe governed by physical laws were first proposed by the greeks and indians[] ancient chinese philosophy encompassed the notion of the universe including both all of space and all of time[] over the centuries improvements in astronomical observations and theories of motion and gravitation led to ever more accurate descriptions of the universe the modern era of cosmology began with albert einstein's  general theory of relativity which made it possible to quantitatively predict the origin evolution and conclusion of the universe as a whole most modern accepted theories of cosmology are based on general relativity and more specifically the predicted big bang[]
mythologies
main articles: creation myth cosmogony and religious cosmology
many cultures have stories describing the origin of the world and universe cultures generally regard these stories as having some truth there are however many differing beliefs in how these stories apply amongst those believing in a supernatural origin ranging from a god directly creating the universe as it is now to a god just setting the "wheels in motion" (for example via mechanisms such as the big bang and evolution)[]
ethnologists and anthropologists who study myths have developed various classification schemes for the various themes that appear in creation stories[][] for example in one type of story the world is born from a world egg; such stories include the finnish epic poem kalevala the chinese story of pangu or the indian brahmanda purana in related stories the universe is created by a single entity emanating or producing something by him- or herself as in the tibetan buddhism concept of adi-buddha the ancient greek story of gaia (mother earth) the aztec goddess coatlicue myth the ancient egyptian god atum story and the judeo-christian genesis creation narrative in which the abrahamic god created the universe in another type of story the universe is created from the union of male and female deities as in the maori story of rangi and papa in other stories the universe is created by crafting it from pre-existing materials such as the corpse of a dead god—as from tiamat in the babylonian epic enuma elish or from the giant ymir in norse mythology—or from chaotic materials as in izanagi and izanami in japanese mythology in other stories the universe emanates from fundamental principles such as brahman and prakrti the creation myth of the serers[] or the yin and yang of the tao
philosophical models

the pre-socratic greek philosophers and indian philosophers developed some of the earliest philosophical concepts of the universe[][] the earliest greek philosophers noted that appearances can be deceiving and sought to understand the underlying reality behind the appearances in particular they noted the ability of matter to change forms (eg ice to water to steam) and several philosophers proposed that all the physical materials in the world are different forms of a single primordial material or arche the first to do so was thales who proposed this material to be water thales' student anaximander proposed that everything came from the limitless apeiron anaximenes proposed the primordial material to be air on account of its perceived attractive and repulsive qualities that cause the arche to condense or dissociate into different forms anaxagoras proposed the principle of nous (mind) while heraclitus proposed fire (and spoke of logos) empedocles proposed the elements to be earth water air and fire his four-element model became very popular like pythagoras plato believed that all things were composed of number with empedocles' elements taking the form of the platonic solids democritus and later philosophers—most notably leucippus—proposed that the universe is composed of indivisible atoms moving through a void (vacuum) although aristotle did not believe that to be feasible because air like water offers resistance to motion air will immediately rush in to fill a void and moreover without resistance it would do so indefinitely fast[]
although heraclitus argued for eternal change[] his contemporary parmenides emphasized changelessness parmenides' poem on nature has been read as saying that all change is an illusion that the true underlying reality is eternally unchanging and of a single nature or at least that the essential feature of each thing that exists must exist eternally without origin change or end[] his student zeno of elea challenged everyday ideas about motion with several famous paradoxes aristotle responded to these paradoxes by developing the notion of a potential countable infinity as well as the infinitely divisible continuum[][] unlike the eternal and unchanging cycles of time he believed that the world is bounded by the celestial spheres and that cumulative stellar magnitude is only finitely multiplicative
the indian philosopher kanada founder of the vaisheshika school developed a notion of atomism and proposed that light and heat were varieties of the same substance[] in the th century ad the buddhist atomist philosopher dignāga proposed atoms to be point-sized durationless and made of energy they denied the existence of substantial matter and proposed that movement consisted of momentary flashes of a stream of energy[]
the notion of temporal finitism was inspired by the doctrine of creation shared by the three abrahamic religions: judaism christianity and islam the christian philosopher john philoponus presented the philosophical arguments against the ancient greek notion of an infinite past and future philoponus' arguments against an infinite past were used by the early muslim philosopher al-kindi (alkindus); the jewish philosopher saadia gaon (saadia ben joseph); and the muslim theologian al-ghazali (algazel)[]
pantheism is the philosophical religious belief that the universe itself is identical to divinity and a supreme being or entity[] ehe physical universe is thus understood as an all-encompassing immanent deity[] the term 'pantheist' designates one who holds both that everything constitutes a unity and that this unity is divine consisting of an all-encompassing manifested god or goddess[][] pantheistic concepts date back thousands of years and pantheistic elements have been identified in various religious traditions
astronomical concepts
main articles: history of astronomy and timeline of astronomy
rd century bce calculations by aristarchus on the relative sizes of from left to right the sun earth and moon from a th-century ad greek copy
the earliest written records of identifiable predecessors to modern astronomy come from ancient egypt and mesopotamia from around  to  bce[][] babylonian astronomers of the th century bce viewed the world as a flat disk surrounded by the ocean[][] and this forms the premise for early greek maps like those of anaximander and hecataeus of miletus
later greek philosophers observing the motions of the heavenly bodies were concerned with developing models of the universe based more profoundly on empirical evidence the first coherent model was proposed by eudoxus of cnidos a student of plato who followed plato's idea that heavenly motions had to be circular in order to account for the known complications of the planets' motions particularly retrograde movement eudoxus' model included  different celestial spheres: four for each of the planets visible to the naked eye three each for the sun and the moon and one for the stars all of these spheres were centered on the earth which remained motionless while they rotated eternally aristotle elaborated upon this model increasing the number of spheres to  in order to account for further details of planetary motion for aristotle normal matter was entirely contained within the terrestrial sphere and it obeyed fundamentally different rules from heavenly material[][]
the post-aristotle treatise de mundo (of uncertain authorship and date) stated "five elements situated in spheres in five regions the less being in each case surrounded by the greater—namely earth surrounded by water water by air air by fire and fire by ether—make up the whole universe"[]
this model was also refined by callippus and after concentric spheres were abandoned it was brought into nearly perfect agreement with astronomical observations by ptolemy[] the success of such a model is largely due to the mathematical fact that any function (such as the position of a planet) can be decomposed into a set of circular functions (the fourier modes) other greek scientists such as the pythagorean philosopher philolaus postulated (according to stobaeus' account) that at the center of the universe was a "central fire" around which the earth sun moon and planets revolved in uniform circular motion[]
the greek astronomer aristarchus of samos was the first known individual to propose a heliocentric model of the universe though the original text has been lost a reference in archimedes' book the sand reckoner describes aristarchus's heliocentric model archimedes wrote:
you king gelon are aware the universe is the name given by most astronomers to the sphere the center of which is the center of the earth while its radius is equal to the straight line between the center of the sun and the center of the earth this is the common account as you have heard from astronomers but aristarchus has brought out a book consisting of certain hypotheses wherein it appears as a consequence of the assumptions made that the universe is many times greater than the universe just mentioned his hypotheses are that the fixed stars and the sun remain unmoved that the earth revolves about the sun on the circumference of a circle the sun lying in the middle of the orbit and that the sphere of fixed stars situated about the same center as the sun is so great that the circle in which he supposes the earth to revolve bears such a proportion to the distance of the fixed stars as the center of the sphere bears to its surface[]
aristarchus thus believed the stars to be very far away and saw this as the reason why stellar parallax had not been observed that is the stars had not been observed to move relative each other as the earth moved around the sun the stars are in fact much farther away than the distance that was generally assumed in ancient times which is why stellar parallax is only detectable with precision instruments the geocentric model consistent with planetary parallax was assumed to be the explanation for the unobservability of stellar parallax[]

the only other astronomer from antiquity known by name who supported aristarchus's heliocentric model was seleucus of seleucia a hellenistic astronomer who lived a century after aristarchus[][][] according to plutarch seleucus was the first to prove the heliocentric system through reasoning but it is not known what arguments he used seleucus' arguments for a heliocentric cosmology were probably related to the phenomenon of tides[] according to strabo () seleucus was the first to state that the tides are due to the attraction of the moon and that the height of the tides depends on the moon's position relative to the sun[] alternatively he may have proved heliocentricity by determining the constants of a geometric model for it and by developing methods to compute planetary positions using this model like what nicolaus copernicus later did in the th century[] during the middle ages heliocentric models were also proposed by the persian astronomers albumasar[] and al-sijzi[]
model of the copernican universe by thomas digges in  with the amendment that the stars are no longer confined to a sphere but spread uniformly throughout the space surrounding the planets
the aristotelian model was accepted in the western world for roughly two millennia until copernicus revived aristarchus's perspective that the astronomical data could be explained more plausibly if the earth rotated on its axis and if the sun were placed at the center of the universe[]
in the center rests the sun for who would place this lamp of a very beautiful temple in another or better place than this wherefrom it can illuminate everything at the same time
— nicolaus copernicus in chapter  book  of de revolutionibus orbium coelestrum ()
as noted by copernicus himself the notion that the earth rotates is very old dating at least to philolaus (c  bc) heraclides ponticus (c  bc) and ecphantus the pythagorean roughly a century before copernicus the christian scholar nicholas of cusa also proposed that the earth rotates on its axis in his book on learned ignorance ()[] al-sijzi[] also proposed that the earth rotates on its axis empirical evidence for the earth's rotation on its axis using the phenomenon of comets was given by tusi (–) and ali qushji (–)[]
this cosmology was accepted by isaac newton christiaan huygens and later scientists[] newton demonstrated that the same laws of motion and gravity apply to earthly and to celestial matter making aristotle's division between the two obsolete edmund halley ()[] and jean-philippe de chéseaux ()[] noted independently that the assumption of an infinite space filled uniformly with stars would lead to the prediction that the nighttime sky would be as bright as the sun itself; this became known as olbers' paradox in the th century[] newton believed that an infinite space uniformly filled with matter would cause infinite forces and instabilities causing the matter to be crushed inwards under its own gravity[] this instability was clarified in  by the jeans instability criterion[] one solution to these paradoxes is the charlier universe in which the matter is arranged hierarchically (systems of orbiting bodies that are themselves orbiting in a larger system ad infinitum) in a fractal way such that the universe has a negligibly small overall density; such a cosmological model had also been proposed earlier in  by johann heinrich lambert[][]
during the th century immanuel kant speculated that nebulae could be entire galaxies separate from the milky way[] and in  alexander von humboldt called these separate galaxies weltinseln or "world islands" a term that later developed into "island universes"[][] in  when the hooker telescope was completed the prevailing view still was that the universe consisted entirely of the milky way galaxy using the hooker telescope edwin hubble identified cepheid variables in several spiral nebulae and in – proved conclusively that andromeda nebula and triangulum among others were entire galaxies outside our own thus proving that the universe consists of a multitude of galaxies[]

by  years ago the first modern humans or homo sapiens had arrived on the indian subcontinent from africa where they had earlier evolved[][][] the earliest known modern human remains in south asia date to about  years ago[] after  bce evidence for domestication of food crops and animals construction of permanent structures and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in mehrgarh and other sites in balochistan pakistan[] these gradually developed into the indus valley civilisation[][] the first urban culture in south asia[] which flourished during – bce in pakistan and western india[] centred around cities such as mohenjo-daro harappa dholavira and kalibangan and relying on varied forms of subsistence the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging trade[]
during the period – bce many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the chalcolithic cultures to the iron age ones[] the vedas the oldest scriptures associated with hinduism[] were composed during this period[] and historians have analysed these to posit a vedic culture in the punjab region and the upper gangetic plain[] most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of indo-aryan migration into the subcontinent from the north-west[] the caste system which created a hierarchy of priests warriors and free peasants but which excluded indigenous peoples by labelling their occupations impure arose during this period[] on the deccan plateau archaeological evidence from this period suggests the existence of a chiefdom stage of political organisation[] in south india a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number of megalithic monuments dating from this period[] as well as by nearby traces of agriculture irrigation tanks and craft traditions[]

in the late vedic period around the th century bce the small states and chiefdoms of the ganges plain and the north-western regions had consolidated into  major oligarchies and monarchies that were known as the mahajanapadas[][] the emerging urbanisation gave rise to non-vedic religious movements two of which became independent religions jainism came into prominence during the life of its exemplar mahavira[] buddhism based on the teachings of gautama buddha attracted followers from all social classes excepting the middle class; chronicling the life of the buddha was central to the beginnings of recorded history in india[][][] in an age of increasing urban wealth both religions held up renunciation as an ideal[] and both established long-lasting monastic traditions politically by the rd century bce the kingdom of magadha had annexed or reduced other states to emerge as the mauryan empire[] the empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent except the far south but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas[][] the mauryan kings are known as much for their empire-building and determined management of public life as for ashoka's renunciation of militarism and far-flung advocacy of the buddhist dhamma[][]
the sangam literature of the tamil language reveals that between  bce and  ce the southern peninsula was ruled by the cheras the cholas and the pandyas dynasties that traded extensively with the roman empire and with west and southeast asia[][] in north india hinduism asserted patriarchal control within the family leading to increased subordination of women[][] by the th and th centuries the gupta empire had created a complex system of administration and taxation in the greater ganges plain; this system became a model for later indian kingdoms[][] under the guptas a renewed hinduism based on devotion rather than the management of ritual began to assert itself[] this renewal was reflected in a flowering of sculpture and architecture which found patrons among an urban elite[] classical sanskrit literature flowered as well and indian science astronomy medicine and mathematics made significant advances[]

the indian early medieval age from  to  ce is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity[] when harsha of kannauj who ruled much of the indo-gangetic plain from  to  ce attempted to expand southwards he was defeated by the chalukya ruler of the deccan[] when his successor attempted to expand eastwards he was defeated by the pala king of bengal[] when the chalukyas attempted to expand southwards they were defeated by the pallavas from farther south who in turn were opposed by the pandyas and the cholas from still farther south[] no ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond their core region[] during this time pastoral peoples whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy were accommodated within caste society as were new non-traditional ruling classes[] the caste system consequently began to show regional differences[]
in the th and th centuries the first devotional hymns were created in the tamil language[] they were imitated all over india and led to both the resurgence of hinduism and the development of all modern languages of the subcontinent[] indian royalty big and small and the temples they patronised drew citizens in great numbers to the capital cities which became economic hubs as well[] temple towns of various sizes began to appear everywhere as india underwent another urbanisation[] by the th and th centuries the effects were felt in south-east asia as south indian culture and political systems were exported to lands that became part of modern-day myanmar thailand laos brunei cambodia vietnam philippines malaysia and indonesia[] indian merchants scholars and sometimes armies were involved in this transmission; south-east asians took the initiative as well with many sojourning in indian seminaries and translating buddhist and hindu texts into their languages[]
after the th century muslim central asian nomadic clans using swift-horse cavalry and raising vast armies united by ethnicity and religion repeatedly overran south asia's north-western plains leading eventually to the establishment of the islamic delhi sultanate in [] the sultanate was to control much of north india and to make many forays into south india although at first disruptive for the indian elites the sultanate largely left its vast non-muslim subject population to its own laws and customs[][] by repeatedly repulsing mongol raiders in the th century the sultanate saved india from the devastation visited on west and central asia setting the scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers learned men mystics traders artists and artisans from that region into the subcontinent thereby creating a syncretic indo-islamic culture in the north[][] the sultanate's raiding and weakening of the regional kingdoms of south india paved the way for the indigenous vijayanagara empire[] embracing a strong shaivite tradition and building upon the military technology of the sultanate the empire came to control much of peninsular india[] and was to influence south indian society for long afterwards[]
early modern india
in the early th century northern india then under mainly muslim rulers[] fell again to the superior mobility and firepower of a new generation of central asian warriors[] the resulting mughal empire did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule instead it balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices[][] and diverse and inclusive ruling elites[] leading to more systematic centralised and uniform rule[] eschewing tribal bonds and islamic identity especially under akbar the mughals united their far-flung realms through loyalty expressed through a persianised culture to an emperor who had near-divine status[] the mughal state's economic policies deriving most revenues from agriculture[] and mandating that taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver currency[] caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets[] the relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the th century was a factor in india's economic expansion[] resulting in greater patronage of painting literary forms textiles and architecture[] newly coherent social groups in northern and western india such as the marathas the rajputs and the sikhs gained military and governing ambitions during mughal rule which through collaboration or adversity gave them both recognition and military experience[] expanding commerce during mughal rule gave rise to new indian commercial and political elites along the coasts of southern and eastern india[] as the empire disintegrated many among these elites were able to seek and control their own affairs[]

by the early th century with the lines between commercial and political dominance being increasingly blurred a number of european trading companies including the english east india company had established coastal outposts[][] the east india company's control of the seas greater resources and more advanced military training and technology led it to increasingly assert its military strength and caused it to become attractive to a portion of the indian elite; these factors were crucial in allowing the company to gain control over the bengal region by  and sideline the other european companies[][][][] its further access to the riches of bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annex or subdue most of india by the s[] india was then no longer exporting manufactured goods as it long had but was instead supplying the british empire with raw materials many historians consider this to be the onset of india's colonial period[] by this time with its economic power severely curtailed by the british parliament and having effectively been made an arm of british administration the east india company began more consciously to enter non-economic arenas including education social reform and culture[]

historians consider india's modern age to have begun sometime between  and  the appointment in  of lord dalhousie as governor general of the east india company set the stage for changes essential to a modern state these included the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty the surveillance of the population and the education of citizens technological changes—among them railways canals and the telegraph—were introduced not long after their introduction in europe[][][][] however disaffection with the company also grew during this time and set off the indian rebellion of  fed by diverse resentments and perceptions including invasive british-style social reforms harsh land taxes and summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes the rebellion rocked many regions of northern and central india and shook the foundations of company rule[][] although the rebellion was suppressed by  it led to the dissolution of the east india company and the direct administration of india by the british government proclaiming a unitary state and a gradual but limited british-style parliamentary system the new rulers also protected princes and landed gentry as a feudal safeguard against future unrest[][] in the decades following public life gradually emerged all over india leading eventually to the founding of the indian national congress in [][][][]
the rush of technology and the commercialisation of agriculture in the second half of the th century was marked by economic setbacks and many small farmers became dependent on the whims of far-away markets[] there was an increase in the number of large-scale famines[] and despite the risks of infrastructure development borne by indian taxpayers little industrial employment was generated for indians[] there were also salutary effects: commercial cropping especially in the newly canalled punjab led to increased food production for internal consumption[] the railway network provided critical famine relief[] notably reduced the cost of moving goods[] and helped nascent indian-owned industry[]

geography

india accounts for the bulk of the indian subcontinent lying atop the indian tectonic plate a part of the indo-australian plate[] india's defining geological processes began  million years ago when the indian plate then part of the southern supercontinent gondwana began a north-eastward drift caused by seafloor spreading to its south-west and later south and south-east[] simultaneously the vast tethyan oceanic crust to its northeast began to subduct under the eurasian plate[] these dual processes driven by convection in the earth's mantle both created the indian ocean and caused the indian continental crust eventually to under-thrust eurasia and to uplift the himalayas[] immediately south of the emerging himalayas plate movement created a vast crescent-shaped trough that rapidly filled with river-borne sediment[] and now constitutes the indo-gangetic plain[] the original indian plate makes its first appearance above the sediment in the ancient aravalli range which extends from the delhi ridge in a southwesterly direction to the west lies the thar desert the eastern spread of which is checked by the aravallis[][][]

india's coastline measures  kilometres ( mi) in length; of this distance  kilometres ( mi) belong to peninsular india and  kilometres ( mi) to the andaman nicobar and lakshadweep island chains[] according to the indian naval hydrographic charts the mainland coastline consists of the following:  sandy beaches;  rocky shores including cliffs; and  mudflats or marshy shores[]
major himalayan-origin rivers that substantially flow through india include the ganges and the brahmaputra both of which drain into the bay of bengal[] important tributaries of the ganges include the yamuna and the kosi; the latter's extremely low gradient caused by long-term silt deposition leads to severe floods and course changes[][] major peninsular rivers whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from flooding include the godavari the mahanadi the kaveri and the krishna which also drain into the bay of bengal;[] and the narmada and the tapti which drain into the arabian sea[] coastal features include the marshy rann of kutch of western india and the alluvial sundarbans delta of eastern india; the latter is shared with bangladesh[] india has two archipelagos: the lakshadweep coral atolls off india's south-western coast; and the andaman and nicobar islands a volcanic chain in the andaman sea[]
indian climate is strongly influenced by the himalayas and the thar desert both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter monsoons[] the himalayas prevent cold central asian katabatic winds from blowing in keeping the bulk of the indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes[][] the thar desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds that between june and october provide the majority of india's rainfall[] four major climatic groupings predominate in india: tropical wet tropical dry subtropical humid and montane[]
temperatures in india have risen by  °c ( °f) between  and [] climate change in india is often thought to be the cause the retreat of himalayan glaciers has adversely affected the flow rate of the major himalayan rivers including the ganges and the brahmaputra[] according to some current projections the number and severity of droughts in india will have markedly increased by the end of the present century[]

a unicellular organism may be either a prokaryote or a eukaryote prokaryotes are represented by two separate domains – bacteria and archaea eukaryotic organisms are characterized by the presence of a membrane-bound cell nucleus and contain additional membrane-bound compartments called organelles (such as mitochondria in animals and plants and plastids in plants and algae all generally considered to be derived from endosymbiotic bacteria)[] fungi animals and plants are examples of kingdoms of organisms within the eukaryotes
estimates on the number of earth's current species range from  million to  trillion[] of which over  million have been documented[] more than  of all species amounting to over five billion species[] that ever lived are estimated to be extinct[][]

etymology
the term "organism" (from greek ὀργανισμός organismos from ὄργανον organon ie "instrument implement tool organ of sense or apprehension")[][] first appeared in the english language in  and took on its current definition by  (oxford english dictionary) it is directly related to the term "organization" there is a long tradition of defining organisms as self-organizing beings going back at least to immanuel kant's  critique of judgment[]
definitions
an organism may be defined as an assembly of molecules functioning as a more or less stable whole that exhibits the properties of life dictionary definitions can be broad using phrases such as "any living structure such as a plant animal fungus or bacterium capable of growth and reproduction"[] many definitions exclude viruses and possible man-made non-organic life forms as viruses are dependent on the biochemical machinery of a host cell for reproduction[] a superorganism is an organism consisting of many individuals working together as a single functional or social unit[]
there has been controversy about the best way to define the organism[] and from a philosophical point of view whether such a definition is necessary[][][] problematic cases include colonial organisms: for instance a colony of eusocial insects fulfils criteria such as adaptive organisation and germ-soma specialisation[] if so the same argument would include some mutualistic and sexual partnerships as organisms[] if group selection occurs then a group could be viewed as a superorganism optimised by group adaptation[] another view is that attributes like autonomy genetic homogeneity and genetic uniqueness should be examined separately rather than demanding that an organism should have all of them; if so there are multiple dimensions to biological individuality resulting in several types of organism[]
other views include the idea that an individual is distinguished by its immune response separating self from foreign;[] that "anti-entropy" the ability to maintain order is what distinguishes an organism;[] or that shannon's information theory can be used to identify organisms as capable of self-maintaining their information content[] finally it may be that the concept of the organism is inadequate in biology[]
viruses
main article: non-cellular life
viruses are not typically considered to be organisms because they are incapable of autonomous reproduction growth or metabolism although some organisms are also incapable of independent survival and live as obligatory intracellular parasites they are capable of independent metabolism and procreation although viruses have a few enzymes and molecules characteristic of living organisms they have no metabolism of their own; they cannot synthesize and organize the organic compounds from which they are formed naturally this rules out autonomous reproduction: they can only be passively replicated by the machinery of the host cell in this sense they are similar to inanimate matter[] viruses have their own genes and they evolve thus an argument that viruses should be classed as living organisms is their ability to undergo evolution and replicate through self-assembly however some scientists argue that viruses neither evolve nor self-reproduce instead viruses are evolved by their host cells meaning that there was co-evolution of viruses and host cells if host cells did not exist viral evolution would be impossible this is not true for cells if viruses did not exist the direction of cellular evolution could be different but cells would nevertheless be able to evolve as for reproduction viruses rely on hosts' machinery to replicate the discovery of viruses with genes coding for energy metabolism and protein synthesis fuelled the debate about whether viruses are living organisms the presence of these genes suggested that viruses were once able to metabolize however it was found later that the genes coding for energy and protein metabolism have a cellular origin most likely these genes were acquired through horizontal gene transfer from viral hosts[]
all organisms consist of structural units called cells; some contain a single cell (unicellular) and others contain many units (multicellular) multicellular organisms are able to specialize cells to perform specific functions a group of such cells is a tissue and in animals these occur as four basic types namely epithelium nervous tissue muscle tissue and connective tissue several types of tissue work together in the form of an organ to produce a particular function (such as the pumping of the blood by the heart or as a barrier to the environment as the skin) this pattern continues to a higher level with several organs functioning as an organ system such as the reproductive system and digestive system many multicellular organisms consist of several organ systems which coordinate to allow for life
cell
the cell theory first developed in  by matthias jakob schleiden and theodor schwann states that all organisms are composed of one or more cells; all cells come from preexisting cells and cells contain the hereditary information necessary for regulating cell functions and for transmitting information to the next generation of cells
there are two types of cells eukaryotic and prokaryotic prokaryotic cells are usually singletons while eukaryotic cells are usually found in multicellular organisms prokaryotic cells lack a nuclear membrane so dna is unbound within the cell; eukaryotic cells have nuclear membranes
all cells whether prokaryotic or eukaryotic have a membrane which envelops the cell separates its interior from its environment regulates what moves in and out and maintains the electric potential of the cell inside the membrane a salty cytoplasm takes up most of the cell volume all cells possess dna the hereditary material of genes and rna containing the information necessary to build various proteins such as enzymes the cell's primary machinery there are also other kinds of biomolecules in cells
all cells share several similar characteristics of:[]
reproduction by cell division (binary fission mitosis or meiosis)
use of enzymes and other proteins coded by dna genes and made via messenger rna intermediates and ribosomes
metabolism including taking in raw materials building cell components converting energy molecules and releasing by-products the functioning of a cell depends upon its ability to extract and use chemical energy stored in organic molecules this energy is derived from metabolic pathways
response to external and internal stimuli such as changes in temperature ph or nutrient levels
cell contents are contained within a cell surface membrane that contains proteins and a lipid bilayer

further information: timeline of the evolutionary history of life
precambrian stromatolites in the siyeh formation glacier national park in  a paper in the scientific journal nature suggested that these  gya (billion years old) geological formations contain fossilized cyanobacteria microbes this suggests they are evidence of one of the earliest known life forms on earth
the last universal common ancestor (luca) is the most recent organism from which all organisms now living on earth descend[] thus it is the most recent common ancestor of all current life on earth the luca is estimated to have lived some  to  billion years ago (sometime in the paleoarchean era)[][] the earliest evidence for life on earth is graphite found to be biogenic in  billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks discovered in western greenland and microbial mat fossils found in  billion-year-old sandstone discovered in western australia[][] although more than  percent of all species that ever lived on the planet are estimated to be extinct[][] it is likely that more than a billion species of life exist on earth currently with the highest estimates and projections reaching one trillion species[]
there is strong evidence from genetics that all organisms have a common ancestor in particular every living cell makes use of nucleic acids as its genetic material and uses the same twenty amino acids as the building blocks for proteins all organisms use the same genetic code (with some extremely rare and minor deviations) to translate nucleic acid sequences into proteins the universality of these traits strongly suggests common ancestry because the selection of many of these traits seems arbitrary horizontal gene transfer makes it more difficult to study the last universal ancestor[] however the universal use of the same genetic code same nucleotides and same amino acids makes the existence of such an ancestor overwhelmingly likely[] the first organisms were possibly anaerobic and thermophilic chemolithoautotrophs that evolved within inorganic compartments at geothermal environments[][]
the most commonly accepted location of the root of the tree of life is between a monophyletic domain bacteria and a clade formed by archaea and eukaryota of what is referred to as the "traditional tree of life" based on several molecular studies[] in  william f martin genetically analyzed  million protein-coding genes from sequenced prokaryotic genomes of various phylogenetic trees and identified  protein clusters from amongst  protein clusters that were probably common to the luca the results "depict luca as anaerobic co-fixing h-dependent with a wood–ljungdahl pathway (the reductive acetyl-coenzyme a pathway) n-fixing and thermophilic luca's biochemistry was replete with fes clusters and radical reaction mechanisms its cofactors reveal dependence upon transition metals flavins s-adenosyl methionine coenzyme a ferredoxin molybdopterin corrins and selenium its genetic code required nucleoside modifications and s-adenosylmethionine-dependent methylations" this depicts methanogenic clostria as a basal clade in the  lineages examined and suggest that the luca inhabited an anaerobic hydrothermal vent setting in a geochemically active environment rich in h co and iron[] however the presence of these genes in luca could also represent later horizontal gene transfers between archaea and bacteria[]
reproduction
main article: reproduction
sexual reproduction is widespread among current eukaryotes and was likely present in the last common ancestor[] this is suggested by the finding of a core set of genes for meiosis in the descendants of lineages that diverged early from the eukaryotic evolutionary tree[] and malik et al[] it is further supported by evidence that eukaryotes previously regarded as "ancient asexuals" such as amoeba were likely sexual in the past and that most present day asexual amoeboid lineages likely arose recently and independently[]
in prokaryotes natural bacterial transformation involves the transfer of dna from one bacterium to another and integration of the donor dna into the recipient chromosome by recombination natural bacterial transformation is considered to be a primitive sexual process and occurs in both bacteria and archaea although it has been studied mainly in bacteria transformation is clearly a bacterial adaptation and not an accidental occurrence because it depends on numerous gene products that specifically interact with each other to enter a state of natural competence to perform this complex process[] transformation is a common mode of dna transfer among prokaryotes[]
human intervention
modern biotechnology is challenging traditional concepts of organisms and species cloning is the process of creating a new multicellular organism genetically identical to another with the potential of creating entirely new species of organisms cloning is the subject of much ethical debate
in  the j craig venter institute assembled a synthetic bacterial genome mycoplasma genitalium by using recombination in yeast of  overlapping dna fragments in a single step the use of yeast recombination greatly simplifies the assembly of large dna molecules from both synthetic and natural fragments[] other companies such as synthetic genomics have already been formed to take advantage of the many commercial uses of custom designed genomes
a planet is a large rounded astronomical body that is neither a star nor its remnant the best available theory of planet formation is the nebular hypothesis which posits that an interstellar cloud collapses out of a nebula to create a young protostar orbited by a protoplanetary disk planets grow in this disk by the gradual accumulation of material driven by gravity a process called accretion the solar system has at least eight planets: the terrestrial planets mercury venus earth and mars and the giant planets jupiter saturn uranus and neptune these planets each rotate around an axis tilted with respect to its orbital pole all planets of the solar system other than mercury possess a considerable atmosphere and some share such features as ice caps seasons volcanism hurricanes tectonics and even hydrology apart from venus and mars the solar system planets generate magnetic fields and all except venus and mercury have natural satellites the giant planets bear planetary rings the most prominent being those of saturn
the word planet probably comes from the greek planḗtai meaning "wanderers" in antiquity this word referred to the sun moon and five points of light visible by the naked eye that moved across the background of the stars—namely mercury venus mars jupiter and saturn planets have historically had religious associations: multiple cultures identified celestial bodies with gods and these connections with mythology and folklore persist in the schemes for naming newly discovered solar system bodies earth itself was recognized as a planet when heliocentrism supplanted geocentrism during the th and th centuries
with the development of the telescope the meaning of planet broadened to include objects only visible with assistance: the moons of the planets beyond earth; the ice giants uranus and neptune; ceres and other bodies later recognized to be part of the asteroid belt; and pluto later found to be the largest member of the collection of icy bodies known as the kuiper belt the discovery of other large objects in the kuiper belt particularly eris spurred debate about how exactly to define a planet the international astronomical union (iau) adopted a standard by which the four terrestrials and four giants qualify placing ceres pluto and eris in the category of dwarf planet[][][] although many planetary scientists have continued to apply the term planet more broadly[]
further advances in astronomy led to the discovery of over five thousand planets outside the solar system termed exoplanets these include hot jupiters—giant planets that orbit close to their parent stars—like  pegasi b super-earths like gliese c that have masses in between that of earth and neptune; and planets smaller than earth like kepler-e multiple exoplanets have been found to orbit in the habitable zones of their stars but earth remains the only planet known to support life
history

 illustration of claudius ptolemy's geocentric model
the idea of planets has evolved over its history from the divine lights of antiquity to the earthly objects of the scientific age the concept has expanded to include worlds not only in the solar system but in multitudes of other extrasolar systems the consensus definition as to what counts as a planet vs other objects orbiting the sun has changed several times previously encompassing asteroids moons and dwarf planets like pluto[][][] and there continues to be some disagreement today[]
the five classical planets of the solar system being visible to the naked eye have been known since ancient times and have had a significant impact on mythology religious cosmology and ancient astronomy in ancient times astronomers noted how certain lights moved across the sky as opposed to the "fixed stars" which maintained a constant relative position in the sky[] ancient greeks called these lights πλάνητες ἀστέρες (planētes asteres "wandering stars") or simply πλανῆται (planētai "wanderers")[] from which today's word "planet" was derived[][][] in ancient greece china babylon and indeed all pre-modern civilizations[][] it was almost universally believed that earth was the center of the universe and that all the "planets" circled earth the reasons for this perception were that stars and planets appeared to revolve around earth each day[] and the apparently common-sense perceptions that earth was solid and stable and that it was not moving but at rest[]
babylon
main article: babylonian astronomy
the first civilization known to have a functional theory of the planets were the babylonians who lived in mesopotamia in the first and second millennia bc the oldest surviving planetary astronomical text is the babylonian venus tablet of ammisaduqa a th-century bc copy of a list of observations of the motions of the planet venus that probably dates as early as the second millennium bc[] the mulapin is a pair of cuneiform tablets dating from the th century bc that lays out the motions of the sun moon and planets over the course of the year[] late babylonian astronomy is the origin of western astronomy and indeed all western efforts in the exact sciences[] the enuma anu enlil written during the neo-assyrian period in the th century bc[] comprises a list of omens and their relationships with various celestial phenomena including the motions of the planets[][] venus mercury and the outer planets mars jupiter and saturn were all identified by babylonian astronomers these would remain the only known planets until the invention of the telescope in early modern times[]
greco-roman astronomy
see also: greek astronomy
the ancient greeks initially did not attach as much significance to the planets as the babylonians in the th and th centuries bc the pythagoreans appear to have developed their own independent planetary theory which consisted of the earth sun moon and planets revolving around a "central fire" at the center of the universe pythagoras or parmenides is said to have been the first to identify the evening star (hesperos) and morning star (phosphoros) as one and the same (aphrodite greek corresponding to latin venus)[] though this had long been known in mesopotamia[][] in the rd century bc aristarchus of samos proposed a heliocentric system according to which earth and the planets revolved around the sun the geocentric system remained dominant until the scientific revolution[]
by the st century bc during the hellenistic period the greeks had begun to develop their own mathematical schemes for predicting the positions of the planets these schemes which were based on geometry rather than the arithmetic of the babylonians would eventually eclipse the babylonians' theories in complexity and comprehensiveness and account for most of the astronomical movements observed from earth with the naked eye these theories would reach their fullest expression in the almagest written by ptolemy in the nd century ce so complete was the domination of ptolemy's model that it superseded all previous works on astronomy and remained the definitive astronomical text in the western world for  centuries[][] to the greeks and romans there were seven known planets each presumed to be circling earth according to the complex laws laid out by ptolemy they were in increasing order from earth (in ptolemy's order and using modern names): the moon mercury venus the sun mars jupiter and saturn[][][]
medieval astronomy
main articles: astronomy in the medieval islamic world and indian astronomy
after the fall of the western roman empire astronomy developed further in india and the medieval islamic world in  ce the indian astronomer aryabhata propounded a planetary model that explicitly incorporated earth's rotation about its axis which he explains as the cause of what appears to be an apparent westward motion of the stars he also theorised that the orbits of planets were elliptical[] aryabhata's followers were particularly strong in south india where his principles of the diurnal rotation of earth among others were followed and a number of secondary works were based on them[]
the astronomy of the islamic golden age mostly took place in the middle east central asia al-andalus and north africa and later in the far east and india these astronomers like the polymath ibn al-haytham generally accepted geocentrism although they did dispute ptolemy's system of epicycles and sought alternatives the th-century astronomer abu sa'id al-sijzi accepted that the earth rotates around its axis[] in the th century the transit of venus was observed by avicenna[] his contemporary al-biruni devised a method of determining the earth's radius using trigonometry that unlike the older method of eratosthenes only required observations at a single mountain[]
scientific revolution and new planets
see also: heliocentrism
with the advent of the scientific revolution and the heliocentric model of copernicus galileo and kepler use of the term "planet" changed from something that moved around the sky relative to the fixed star to a body that orbited the sun directly (a primary planet) or indirectly (a secondary or satellite planet) thus the earth was added to the roster of planets[] and the sun was removed the copernican count of primary planets stood until  when william herschel discovered uranus[]
when four satellites of jupiter (the galilean moons) and five of saturn were discovered in the th century they were thought of as "satellite planets" or "secondary planets" orbiting the primary planets though in the following decades they would come to be called simply "satellites" for short scientists generally considered planetary satellites to also be planets until about the s although this usage was not common among non-scientists[]
in the first decade of the th century four new planets were discovered: ceres (in ) pallas (in ) juno (in ) and vesta (in ) it soon became apparent that they were rather different from previously known planets: they shared the same general region of space between mars and jupiter (the asteroid belt) with sometimes overlapping orbits this was an area where only one planet had been expected and they were much much smaller than all other planets; indeed it was suspected that they might be shards of a larger planet that had broken up herschel called them asteroids (from the greek for "starlike") because even in the largest telescopes they resembled stars without a resolvable disk[][]
the situation was stable for four decades but in the mid-s several additional asteroids were discovered (astraea in  hebe and iris in  flora and metis in  and hygiea in ) new "planets" were discovered every year; as a result astronomers began tabulating the asteroids (minor planets) separately from the major planets and assigning them numbers instead of abstract planetary symbols[] although they continued to be considered as small planets[]
neptune was discovered in  its position having been predicted thanks to its gravitational influence upon uranus because the orbit of mercury appeared to be affected in a similar way it was believed in the late th century that there might be another planet even closer to the sun however the discrepancy between mercury's orbit and the predictions of newtonian gravity was instead explained by an improved theory of gravity einstein's general relativity[][]
th century
pluto was discovered in  after initial observations led to the belief that it was larger than earth[] the object was immediately accepted as the ninth major planet further monitoring found the body was actually much smaller: in  ray lyttleton suggested that pluto may be an escaped satellite of neptune[] and fred whipple suggested in  that pluto may be a comet[] the discovery of its large moon charon in  showed that pluto was only  the mass of earth[] as this was still substantially more massive than any known asteroid and because no other trans-neptunian objects had been discovered at that time pluto kept its planetary status only officially losing it in [][]
in the s gerard kuiper published papers on the origin of the asteroids he recognised that asteroids were typically not spherical as had previously been thought and that the asteroid families were remnants of collisions thus he differentiated between the largest asteroids as "true planets" versus the smaller ones as collisional fragments from the s onwards the term "minor planet" was mostly displaced by the term "asteroid" and references to the asteroids as planets in the literature became scarce except for the geologically evolved largest three: ceres and less often pallas and vesta[]
the beginning of solar system exploration by space probes in the s spurred a renewed interest in planetary science a split in definitions regarding satellites occurred around then: planetary scientists began to reconsider the large moons as also being planets but astronomers who were not planetary scientists generally did not[]
in  astronomers aleksander wolszczan and dale frail announced the discovery of planets around a pulsar psr b+[] this discovery is generally considered to be the first definitive detection of a planetary system around another star then on  october  michel mayor and didier queloz of the geneva observatory announced the first definitive detection of an exoplanet orbiting an ordinary main-sequence star ( pegasi)[]
the discovery of extrasolar planets led to another ambiguity in defining a planet: the point at which a planet becomes a star many known extrasolar planets are many times the mass of jupiter approaching that of stellar objects known as brown dwarfs brown dwarfs are generally considered stars due to their theoretical ability to fuse deuterium a heavier isotope of hydrogen although objects more massive than  times that of jupiter fuse simple hydrogen objects of  jupiter masses can fuse deuterium deuterium is quite rare constituting less than  of the hydrogen in the galaxy and most brown dwarfs would have ceased fusing deuterium long before their discovery making them effectively indistinguishable from supermassive planets[]
st century
with the discovery during the latter half of the th century of more objects within the solar system and large objects around other stars disputes arose over what should constitute a planet there were particular disagreements over whether an object should be considered a planet if it was part of a distinct population such as a belt or if it was large enough to generate energy by the thermonuclear fusion of deuterium[] complicating the matter even further bodies too small to generate energy by fusing deuterium can form by gas-cloud collapse just like stars and brown dwarfs even down to the mass of jupiter:[] there was thus disagreement about whether how a body formed should be taken into account[]
a growing number of astronomers argued for pluto to be declassified as a planet because many similar objects approaching its size had been found in the same region of the solar system (the kuiper belt) during the s and early s pluto was found to be just one small body in a population of thousands[] they often referred to the demotion of the asteroids as a precedent although that had been done based on their geophysical differences from planets rather than their being in a belt[] some of the larger trans-neptunian objects such as quaoar sedna eris and haumea[] were heralded in the popular press as the tenth planet the announcement of eris in  an object  more massive than pluto created the impetus for an official definition of a planet[] as considering pluto a planet would logically have demanded that eris be considered a planet as well since different procedures were in place for naming planets versus non-planets this created an urgent situation because under the rules eris could not be named without defining what a planet was[] at the time it was also thought that the size required for a trans-neptunian object to become round was about the same as that required for the moons of the giant planets (about  km diameter) a figure that would have suggested about  round objects in the kuiper belt and thousands more beyond[][] many astronomers argued that the public would not accept a definition creating a large number of planets[]
to acknowledge the problem the iau set about creating the definition of planet and produced one in august  their definition dropped to the eight significantly larger bodies that had cleared their orbit (mercury venus earth mars jupiter saturn uranus and neptune) and a new class of dwarf planets was created initially containing three objects (ceres pluto and eris)[]
this definition has not been universally used or accepted in planetary geology celestial objects have been assessed and defined as planets by geophysical characteristics planetary scientists are more interested in planetary geology than dynamics so they classify planets based on their geological properties a celestial body may acquire a dynamic (planetary) geology at approximately the mass required for its mantle to become plastic under its own weight this leads to a state of hydrostatic equilibrium where the body acquires a stable round shape which is adopted as the hallmark of planethood by geophysical definitions for example:[]
a substellar-mass body that has never undergone nuclear fusion and has enough gravitation to be round due to hydrostatic equilibrium regardless of its orbital parameters[]
in the solar system this mass is generally less than the mass required for a body to clear its orbit and thus some objects that are considered "planets" under geophysical definitions are not considered as such under the iau definition such as ceres and pluto[] proponents of such definitions often argue that location should not matter and that planethood should be defined by the intrinsic properties of an object[] dwarf planets had been proposed as a category of small planet (as opposed to planetoids as sub-planetary objects) and planetary geologists continue to treat them as planets despite the iau definition[]
the largest known trans-neptunian objects with their moons; the earth and moon have been added for comparison all pictures are artist's impressions except for the pluto and earth systems
the number of dwarf planets even among known objects is not certain in  grundy et al argued based on the low densities of some mid-sized trans-neptunian objects that the limiting size required for a trans-neptunian object to reach equilibrium was in fact much larger than it is for the icy moons of the giant planets being about  km diameter[] there is general consensus on ceres in the asteroid belt[] and on the eight trans-neptunians that probably cross this threshold: quaoar sedna orcus pluto haumea eris makemake and gonggong[] planetary geologists may include the nineteen known planetary-mass moons as "satellite planets" including earth's moon and pluto's charon like the early modern astronomers[][] some go even further and include as planets relatively large geologically evolved bodies that are nonetheless not very round today such as pallas and vesta[] or rounded bodies that were completely disrupted by impacts and re-accreted like hygiea[][][]
the  iau definition presents some challenges for exoplanets because the language is specific to the solar system and the criteria of roundness and orbital zone clearance are not presently observable for exoplanets[] there is no official definition of exoplanets but the iau's working group on the topic adopted a provisional statement in 
astronomer jean-luc margot proposed a mathematical criterion that determines whether an object can clear its orbit during the lifetime of its host star based on the mass of the planet its semimajor axis and the mass of its host star[] the formula produces a value called π that is greater than  for planets[a] the eight known planets and all known exoplanets have π values above  while ceres pluto and eris have π values of  or less objects with π values of  or more are expected to be approximately spherical so that objects that fulfill the orbital-zone clearance requirement around sun-like stars will also fulfill the roundness requirement[]
definition and similar concepts

euler diagram showing the iau executive committee conception of the types of bodies in the solar system
at the  meeting of the iau's general assembly after much debate and one failed proposal the following definition was passed in a resolution voted for by a large majority of those remaining at the meeting addressing particularly the issue of the lower limits for a celestial object to be defined as a planet the  resolution defines planets within the solar system as follows:[]
a "planet" [] is a celestial body inside the solar system that (a) is in orbit around the sun (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape and (c) has cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit
[] the eight planets are: mercury venus earth mars jupiter saturn uranus and neptune
under this definition the solar system is considered to have eight planets bodies that fulfill the first two conditions but not the third are classified as dwarf planets provided they are not natural satellites of other planets originally an iau committee had proposed a definition that would have included a larger number of planets as it did not include (c) as a criterion[] after much discussion it was decided via a vote that those bodies should instead be classified as dwarf planets[]
this definition is based in modern theories of planetary formation in which planetary embryos initially clear their orbital neighborhood of other smaller objects as described below planets form by material accreting together in a disk of matter surrounding a protostar this process results in a collection of relatively substantial objects each of which has either "swept up" or scattered away most of the material that had been orbiting near it these objects do not collide with one another because they are too far apart sometimes in orbital resonance[]
exoplanet
main article: exoplanet § definition
the  iau definition presents some challenges for exoplanets because the language is specific to the solar system and the criteria of roundness and orbital zone clearance are not presently observable for exoplanets[] the iau working group on extrasolar planets (wgesp) issued a working definition in  and amended it in [] in  this definition was reassessed and updated as knowledge of exoplanets increased[] the current official working definition of an exoplanet is as follows:[]
objects with true masses below the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium (currently calculated to be  jupiter masses for objects of solar metallicity) that orbit stars brown dwarfs or stellar remnants and that have a mass ratio with the central object below the l/l instability (m/mcentral < /(+√) are "planets" (no matter how they formed) the minimum mass/size required for an extrasolar object to be considered a planet should be the same as that used in our solar system
substellar objects with true masses above the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium are "brown dwarfs" no matter how they formed nor where they are located
free-floating objects in young star clusters with masses below the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium are not "planets" but are "sub-brown dwarfs" (or whatever name is most appropriate)[]
the iau noted that this definition could be expected to evolve as knowledge improves[] a  review article discussing the history and rationale of this definition suggested that the words "in young star clusters" should be deleted in clause  as such objects have now been found elsewhere and that the term "sub-brown dwarfs" should be replaced by the more current "free-floating planetary mass objects"[]

geoscientists often reject the iau definition preferring to consider round moons and dwarf planets as also being planets some scientists who accept the iau definition of "planet" use other terms for bodies satisfying geophysical planet definitions such as "world"[] the term "planetary mass object" has also been used to refer to ambiguous situations concerning exoplanets such as objects with mass typical for a planet that are free-floating or orbit a brown dwarf instead of a star[]
mythology and naming
see also: weekday names and classical planet
the naming of planets differs between planets of the solar system and exoplanets (planets of other planetary systems) extrasolar planets are commonly named after their parent star and their order of discovery within its planetary system such as proxima centauri b
the names for the planets of the solar system (other than earth) in the english language are derived from naming practices developed consecutively by the babylonians greeks and romans of antiquity the practice of grafting the names of gods onto the planets was almost certainly borrowed from the babylonians by the ancient greeks and thereafter from the greeks by the romans the babylonians named venus after the sumerian goddess of love with the akkadian name ishtar; mars after their god of war nergal; mercury after their god of wisdom nabu; and jupiter after their chief god marduk[] there are too many concordances between greek and babylonian naming conventions for them to have arisen separately[] given the differences in mythology the correspondence was not perfect for instance the babylonian nergal was a god of war and thus the greeks identified him with ares unlike ares nergal was also a god of pestilence and ruler of the underworld[][][]
in ancient greece the two great luminaries the sun and the moon were called helios and selene two ancient titanic deities; the slowest planet saturn was called phainon the shiner; followed by phaethon jupiter "bright"; the red planet mars was known as pyroeis the "fiery"; the brightest venus was known as phosphoros the light bringer; and the fleeting final planet mercury was called stilbon the gleamer the greeks assigned each planet to one among their pantheon of gods the olympians and the earlier titans:[]
helios and selene were the names of both planets and gods both of them titans (later supplanted by olympians apollo and artemis);
phainon was sacred to cronus the titan who fathered the olympians;
phaethon was sacred to zeus cronus's son who deposed him as king;
pyroeis was given to ares son of zeus and god of war;
phosphoros was ruled by aphrodite the goddess of love; and

although modern greeks still use their ancient names for the planets other european languages because of the influence of the roman empire and later the catholic church use the roman (latin) names rather than the greek ones the romans inherited proto-indo-european mythology as the greeks did and shared with them a common pantheon under different names but the romans lacked the rich narrative traditions that greek poetic culture had given their gods during the later period of the roman republic roman writers borrowed much of the greek narratives and applied them to their own pantheon to the point where they became virtually indistinguishable[] when the romans studied greek astronomy they gave the planets their own gods' names: mercurius (for hermes) venus (aphrodite) mars (ares) iuppiter (zeus) and saturnus (cronus) some romans following a belief possibly originating in mesopotamia but developed in hellenistic egypt believed that the seven gods after whom the planets were named took hourly shifts in looking after affairs on earth the order of shifts went saturn jupiter mars sun venus mercury moon (from the farthest to the closest planet)[] therefore the first day was started by saturn (st hour) second day by sun (th hour) followed by moon (th hour) mars mercury jupiter and venus because each day was named by the god that started it this became the order of the days of the week in the roman calendar[] in english saturday sunday and monday are straightforward translations of these roman names the other days were renamed after tīw (tuesday) wōden (wednesday) þunor (thursday) and frīġ (friday) the anglo-saxon gods considered similar or equivalent to mars mercury jupiter and venus respectively[]
earth's name in english is not derived from greco-roman mythology because it was only generally accepted as a planet in the th century[] there is no tradition of naming it after a god (the same is true in english at least of the sun and the moon though they are no longer generally considered planets) the name originates from the old english word eorþe which was the word for "ground" and "dirt" as well as the world itself[] as with its equivalents in the other germanic languages it derives ultimately from the proto-germanic word erþō as can be seen in the english earth the german erde the dutch aarde and the scandinavian jord many of the romance languages retain the old roman word terra (or some variation of it) that was used with the meaning of "dry land" as opposed to "sea"[] the non-romance languages use their own native words the greeks retain their original name γή (ge)[]
non-european cultures use other planetary-naming systems india uses a system based on the navagraha which incorporates the seven traditional planets and the ascending and descending lunar nodes rahu and ketu the planets are surya 'sun' chandra 'moon' budha for mercury shukra ('bright') for venus mangala (the god of war) for mars bṛhaspati (councilor of the gods) for jupiter and shani (symbolic of time) for saturn[]
the native persian names of most of the planets are based on identifications of the mesopotamian gods with iranian gods analogous to the greek and latin names mercury is tir (تیر) for the western iranian god tīriya (patron of scribes) analogous to nabu; venus is nāhid (ناهید) for anahita; mars is bahrām (بهرام) for verethragna; and jupiter is hormoz (هرمز) for ahura mazda the persian name for saturn keyvān (کیوان) is a borrowing from akkadian kajamānu meaning "the permanent steady"[]
china and the countries of eastern asia historically subject to chinese cultural influence (such as japan korea and vietnam) use a naming system based on the five chinese elements: water (mercury 水星 "water star") metal (venus 金星 "metal star") fire (mars 火星 "fire star") wood (jupiter 木星 "wood star") and earth (saturn 土星 "earth star")[] the names of uranus (天王星 "sky king star") neptune (海王星 "sea king star") and pluto (冥王星 "underworld king star") in chinese korean and japanese are calques based on the roles of those gods in roman and greek mythology[][][b] in the th century alexander wylie and li shanlan calqued the names of the first  asteroids into chinese and many of their names are still used today eg ceres (穀神星 "grain goddess star") pallas (智神星 "wisdom goddess star") juno (婚神星 "marriage goddess star") vesta (灶神星 "hearth goddess star") and hygiea (健神星 "health goddess star")[] such translations were extended to some later minor planets including some of the dwarf planets discovered in the st century eg haumea (妊神星 "pregnancy goddess star" makemake (鳥神星 "bird goddess star") and eris (鬩神星 "quarrel goddess star") however except for the better-known asteroids and dwarf planets many of them are rare outside chinese astronomical dictionaries[]
in traditional hebrew astronomy the seven traditional planets have (for the most part) descriptive names – the sun is חמה ḥammah or "the hot one" the moon is לבנה levanah or "the white one" venus is כוכב נוגה kokhav nogah or "the bright planet" mercury is כוכב kokhav or "the planet" (given its lack of distinguishing features) mars is מאדים ma'adim or "the red one" and saturn is שבתאי shabbatai or "the resting one" (in reference to its slow movement compared to the other visible planets)[] the odd one out is jupiter called צדק tzedeq or "justice"[] hebrew names were chosen for uranus (אורון oron "small light") and neptune (רהב rahab a biblical sea monster) in ;[] prior to that the names "uranus" and "neptune" had simply been borrowed[] the etymologies for the arabic names of the planets are less well understood mostly agreed among scholars are venus الزهرة (az-zuhara "the bright one"[]) earth الأرض (al-ʾarḍ from the same root as eretz) and saturn زُحَل (zuḥal "withdrawer"[]) multiple suggested etymologies exist for mercury عُطَارِد (ʿuṭārid) mars اَلْمِرِّيخ (al-mirrīkh) and jupiter المشتري (al-muštarī) but there is no agreement among scholars[][][][]
when subsequent planets were discovered in the th and th centuries uranus was named for a greek deity and neptune for a roman one (the counterpart of poseidon) the asteroids were initially named from mythology as well – ceres juno and vesta are major roman goddesses and pallas is an epithet of the major greek goddess athena – but as more and more were discovered they first started being named after more minor goddesses and the mythological restriction was dropped starting from the twentieth asteroid massalia in [] pluto was given a classical name as it was considered a major planet when it was discovered after more objects were discovered beyond neptune naming conventions depending on their orbits were put in place: those in the : resonance with neptune (the plutinos) are given names from underworld myths while others are given names from creation myths most of the trans-neptunian dwarf planets are named after gods and goddesses from other cultures (eg quaoar is named after a tongva god) except for orcus and eris which continued the roman and greek scheme[][]
the moons (including the planetary-mass ones) are generally given names with some association with their parent planet the planetary-mass moons of jupiter are named after four of zeus' lovers (or other sexual partners); those of saturn are named after cronus' brothers and sisters the titans; those of uranus are named after characters from shakespeare and pope (originally specifically from fairy mythology[] but that ended with the naming of miranda) neptune's planetary-mass moon triton is named after the god's son; pluto's planetary-mass moon charon is named after the ferryman of the dead who carries the souls of the newly deceased to the underworld (pluto's domain)[]
the written symbols for mercury venus jupiter saturn and possibly mars have been traced to forms found in late greek papyrus texts[] the symbols for jupiter and saturn are identified as monograms of the corresponding greek names and the symbol for mercury is a stylized caduceus[]
according to annie scott dill maunder antecedents of the planetary symbols were used in art to represent the gods associated with the classical planets bianchini's planisphere discovered by francesco bianchini in the th century but produced in the nd century[] shows greek personifications of planetary gods charged with early versions of the planetary symbols mercury has a caduceus; venus has attached to her necklace a cord connected to another necklace; mars a spear; jupiter a staff; saturn a scythe; the sun a circlet with rays radiating from it; and the moon a headdress with a crescent attached[] the modern shapes with the cross-marks first appeared around the th century according to maunder the addition of crosses appears to be "an attempt to give a savour of christianity to the symbols of the old pagan gods"[] earth itself was not considered a classical planet; its symbol descends from a pre-heliocentric symbol for the four corners of the world[]
when further planets were discovered orbiting the sun symbols were invented for them the most common astronomical symbol for uranus [] was invented by johann gottfried köhler and was intended to represent the newly discovered metal platinum[][] an alternative symbol  was invented by jérôme lalande and represents a globe with a h on top for uranus' discoverer herschel[] today  is mostly used by astronomers and  by astrologers though it is possible to find each symbol in the other context[] the first few asteroids were similarly given abstract symbols eg ceres' sickle () pallas' spear (⚴) juno's sceptre (⚵) and vesta's hearth () but as their number rose further and further this practice stopped in favour of numbering them instead (massalia the first asteroid not named from mythology is also the first asteroid that was not assigned a symbol by its discoverer)[] neptune's symbol () represents the god's trident[] the astronomical symbol for pluto is a p-l monogram ()[] though it has become less common since the iau definition reclassified pluto[] since pluto's reclassification nasa has used the traditional astrological symbol of pluto (⯓) a planetary orb over pluto's bident[]
the iau discourages the use of planetary symbols in modern journal articles in favour of one-letter or (to disambiguate mercury and mars) two-letter abbreviations for the major planets the symbols for the sun and earth are nonetheless common as solar mass earth mass and similar units are common in astronomy[] other planetary symbols today are mostly encountered in astrology astrologers have resurrected the old astronomical symbols for the first few asteroids and continue to invent symbols for other objects[] unicode includes some relatively standard astrological symbols for minor planets including dwarf planets discovered in the st century though astronomical use of any of them is rare in particular the eris symbol is a traditional one from discordianism a religion worshipping the goddess eris the other dwarf-planet symbols are mostly initialisms (except haumea) in the native scripts of the cultures they come from; they also represent something associated with the corresponding deity or culture eg orcus' gape makemake's face or gonggong's snake-tail[][]
asteroids colliding during planet formation
it is not known with certainty how planets are built the prevailing theory is that they are formed during the collapse of a nebula into a thin disk of gas and dust a protostar forms at the core surrounded by a rotating protoplanetary disk through accretion (a process of sticky collision) dust particles in the disk steadily accumulate mass to form ever-larger bodies local concentrations of mass known as planetesimals form and these accelerate the accretion process by drawing in additional material by their gravitational attraction these concentrations become ever denser until they collapse inward under gravity to form protoplanets[] after a planet reaches a mass somewhat larger than mars' mass it begins to accumulate an extended atmosphere[] greatly increasing the capture rate of the planetesimals by means of atmospheric drag[][] depending on the accretion history of solids and gas a giant planet an ice giant or a terrestrial planet may result[][][] it is thought that the regular satellites of jupiter saturn and uranus formed in a similar way;[][] however triton was likely captured by neptune[] and earth's moon[] and pluto's charon might have formed in collisions[]
when the protostar has grown such that it ignites to form a star the surviving disk is removed from the inside outward by photoevaporation the solar wind poynting–robertson drag and other effects[][] thereafter there still may be many protoplanets orbiting the star or each other but over time many will collide either to form a larger combined protoplanet or release material for other protoplanets to absorb[] those objects that have become massive enough will capture most matter in their orbital neighbourhoods to become planets protoplanets that have avoided collisions may become natural satellites of planets through a process of gravitational capture or remain in belts of other objects to become either dwarf planets or small bodies[][]
supernova remnant ejecta producing planet-forming material
the energetic impacts of the smaller planetesimals (as well as radioactive decay) will heat up the growing planet causing it to at least partially melt the interior of the planet begins to differentiate by density with higher density materials sinking toward the core[] smaller terrestrial planets lose most of their atmospheres because of this accretion but the lost gases can be replaced by outgassing from the mantle and from the subsequent impact of comets[] (smaller planets will lose any atmosphere they gain through various escape mechanisms[])
with the discovery and observation of planetary systems around stars other than the sun it is becoming possible to elaborate revise or even replace this account the level of metallicity—an astronomical term describing the abundance of chemical elements with an atomic number greater than  (helium)—appears to determine the likelihood that a star will have planets[][] hence a metal-rich population i star is more likely to have a substantial planetary system than a metal-poor population ii star[]
solar system
main article: solar system
the solar system including the sun planets dwarf planets and the larger moons (except iapetus) distances between the bodies are not to scale
according to the iau definition there are eight planets in the solar system which are (in increasing distance from the sun):[] mercury venus earth mars jupiter saturn uranus and neptune jupiter is the largest at  earth masses whereas mercury is the smallest at  earth masses[]
the planets of the solar system can be divided into categories based on their composition terrestrials are similar to earth with bodies largely composed of rock and metal: mercury venus earth and mars earth is the largest terrestrial planet[] giant planets are significantly more massive than the terrestrials: jupiter saturn uranus and neptune[] they differ from the terrestrial planets in composition the gas giants jupiter and saturn are primarily composed of hydrogen and helium and are the most massive planets in the solar system saturn is one third as massive as jupiter at  earth masses[] the ice giants uranus and neptune are primarily composed of low-boiling-point materials such as water methane and ammonia with thick atmospheres of hydrogen and helium they have a significantly lower mass than the gas giants (only  and  earth masses)[]
dwarf planets are gravitationally rounded but have not cleared their orbits of other bodies in increasing order of average distance from the sun the ones generally agreed among astronomers are ceres orcus pluto haumea quaoar makemake gonggong eris and sedna[] ceres is the largest object in the asteroid belt located between the orbits of mars and jupiter the other eight all orbit beyond neptune orcus pluto haumea quaoar and makemake orbit in the kuiper belt which is a second belt of small solar system bodies beyond the orbit of neptune gonggong and eris orbit in the scattered disc which is somewhat further out and unlike the kuiper belt is unstable towards interactions with neptune sedna is the largest known detached object a population that never comes close enough to the sun to interact with any of the classical planets; the origins of their orbits are still being debated all nine are similar to terrestrial planets in having a solid surface but they are made of ice and rock rather than rock and metal moreover all of them are smaller than mercury with pluto being the largest known dwarf planet and eris being the most massive known[][]
there are at least nineteen planetary-mass moons or satellite planets—moons large enough to take on ellipsoidal shapes:[]
one satellite of earth: the moon
four satellites of jupiter: io europa ganymede and callisto
seven satellites of saturn: mimas enceladus tethys dione rhea titan and iapetus
five satellites of uranus: miranda ariel umbriel titania and oberon
one satellite of neptune: triton
one satellite of pluto: charon
the moon io and europa have compositions similar to the terrestrial planets; the others are made of ice and rock like the dwarf planets with tethys being made of almost pure ice (europa is often considered an icy planet though because its surface ice layer makes it difficult to study its interior[][]) ganymede and titan are larger than mercury by radius and callisto almost equals it but all three are much less massive mimas is the smallest object generally agreed to be a geophysical planet at about six millionths of earth's mass though there are many larger bodies that may not be geophysical planets (eg salacia)[]
an exoplanet (extrasolar planet) is a planet outside the solar system as of  september  there are  confirmed exoplanets in  planetary systems with  systems having more than one planet[] known exoplanets range in size from gas giants about twice as large as jupiter down to just over the size of the moon analysis of gravitational microlensing data suggests a minimum average of  bound planets for every star in the milky way[]
in early  radio astronomers aleksander wolszczan and dale frail announced the discovery of two planets orbiting the pulsar psr +[] this discovery was confirmed and is generally considered to be the first definitive detection of exoplanets researchers suspect they formed from a disk remnant left over from the supernova that produced the pulsar[]
the first confirmed discovery of an extrasolar planet orbiting an ordinary main-sequence star occurred on  october  when michel mayor and didier queloz of the university of geneva announced the detection of  pegasi b an exoplanet around  pegasi[] from then until the kepler mission most known extrasolar planets were gas giants comparable in mass to jupiter or larger as they were more easily detected the catalog of kepler candidate planets consists mostly of planets the size of neptune and smaller down to smaller than mercury[][]
in  the kepler space telescope team reported the discovery of the first earth-sized extrasolar planets orbiting a sun-like star kepler-e and kepler-f[][][] since that time more than  planets have been identified that are approximately the same size as earth  of which orbit in the habitable zone of their star – the range of orbits where a terrestrial planet could sustain liquid water on its surface given enough atmospheric pressure[][][] one in five sun-like stars is thought to have an earth-sized planet in its habitable zone which suggests that the nearest would be expected to be within  light-years distance from earth[c] the frequency of occurrence of such terrestrial planets is one of the variables in the drake equation which estimates the number of intelligent communicating civilizations that exist in the milky way[]
there are types of planets that do not exist in the solar system: super-earths and mini-neptunes which have masses between that of earth and neptune such planets could be rocky like earth or a mixture of volatiles and gas like neptune—the dividing line between the two possibilities is currently thought to occur at about twice the mass of earth[] the planet gliese c with mass – times the mass of earth[] attracted attention upon its discovery for potentially being in the habitable zone[] though later studies concluded that it is actually too close to its star to be habitable[] exoplanets have been found that are much closer to their parent star than any planet in the solar system is to the sun mercury the closest planet to the sun at  au takes  days for an orbit but ultra-short period planets can orbit in less than a day the kepler- system has five of its planets in shorter orbits than mercury's all of them much more massive than mercury there are hot jupiters such as  pegasi b[] that orbit very close to their star and may evaporate to become chthonian planets which are the leftover cores there are also exoplanets that are much farther from their star neptune is  au from the sun and takes  years to orbit but there are exoplanets that are thousands of au from their star and take more than a million years to orbit eg coconuts-b[]
attributes
although each planet has unique physical characteristics a number of broad commonalities do exist among them some of these characteristics such as rings or natural satellites have only as yet been observed in planets in the solar system whereas others are commonly observed in extrasolar planets[]
dynamic characteristics
orbit
main articles: orbit and orbital elements
see also: kepler's laws of planetary motion and exoplanetology § orbital parameters
the orbit of the planet neptune compared to that of pluto note the elongation of pluto's orbit in relation to neptune's (eccentricity) as well as its large angle to the ecliptic (inclination)
in the solar system all the planets orbit the sun in the same direction as the sun rotates: counter-clockwise as seen from above the sun's north pole at least one extrasolar planet wasp-b has been found to orbit in the opposite direction to its star's rotation[] the period of one revolution of a planet's orbit is known as its sidereal period or year[] a planet's year depends on its distance from its star; the farther a planet is from its star the longer the distance it must travel and the slower its speed since it is less affected by its star's gravity
no planet's orbit is perfectly circular and hence the distance of each from the host star varies over the course of its year the closest approach to its star is called its periastron or perihelion in the solar system whereas its farthest separation from the star is called its apastron (aphelion) as a planet approaches periastron its speed increases as it trades gravitational potential energy for kinetic energy just as a falling object on earth accelerates as it falls as the planet nears apastron its speed decreases just as an object thrown upwards on earth slows down as it reaches the apex of its trajectory[]
each planet's orbit is delineated by a set of elements:
the eccentricity of an orbit describes the elongation of a planet's elliptical (oval) orbit planets with low eccentricities have more circular orbits whereas planets with high eccentricities have more elliptical orbits the planets and large moons in the solar system have relatively low eccentricities and thus nearly circular orbits[] the comets and many kuiper belt objects as well as several extrasolar planets have very high eccentricities and thus exceedingly elliptical orbits[][]
the semi-major axis gives the size of the orbit it is the distance from the midpoint to the longest diameter of its elliptical orbit this distance is not the same as its apastron because no planet's orbit has its star at its exact centre[]
the inclination of a planet tells how far above or below an established reference plane its orbit is tilted in the solar system the reference plane is the plane of earth's orbit called the ecliptic for extrasolar planets the plane known as the sky plane or plane of the sky is the plane perpendicular to the observer's line of sight from earth[] the eight planets of the solar system all lie very close to the ecliptic; comets and kuiper belt objects like pluto are at far more extreme angles to it[] the large moons are generally not very inclined to their parent planets' equators but earth's moon saturn's iapetus and neptune's triton are exceptions triton is unique among the large moons in that it orbits retrograde ie in the direction opposite to its parent planet's rotation[]
the points at which a planet crosses above and below its reference plane are called its ascending and descending nodes[] the longitude of the ascending node is the angle between the reference plane's  longitude and the planet's ascending node the argument of periapsis (or perihelion in the solar system) is the angle between a planet's ascending node and its closest approach to its star[]
axial tilt
main article: axial tilt
earth's axial tilt is about ° it oscillates between ° and ° on a -year cycle and is currently decreasing
planets have varying degrees of axial tilt; they spin at an angle to the plane of their stars' equators this causes the amount of light received by each hemisphere to vary over the course of its year; when the northern hemisphere points away from its star the southern hemisphere points towards it and vice versa each planet therefore has seasons resulting in changes to the climate over the course of its year the time at which each hemisphere points farthest or nearest from its star is known as its solstice each planet has two in the course of its orbit; when one hemisphere has its summer solstice with its day being the longest the other has its winter solstice when its day is shortest the varying amount of light and heat received by each hemisphere creates annual changes in weather patterns for each half of the planet jupiter's axial tilt is very small so its seasonal variation is minimal; uranus on the other hand has an axial tilt so extreme it is virtually on its side which means that its hemispheres are either continually in sunlight or continually in darkness around the time of its solstices[] in the solar system mercury venus ceres and jupiter have very small tilts; pallas uranus and pluto have extreme ones; and earth mars vesta saturn and neptune have moderate ones[][][][] among extrasolar planets axial tilts are not known for certain though most hot jupiters are believed to have a negligible axial tilt as a result of their proximity to their stars[] similarly the axial tilts of the planetary-mass moons are near zero[] with earth's moon at ° as the biggest exception;[] additionally callisto's axial tilt varies between  and about  degrees on timescales of thousands of years[]
rotation
see also: exoplanetology § rotation and axial tilt
the planets rotate around invisible axes through their centres a planet's rotation period is known as a stellar day most of the planets in the solar system rotate in the same direction as they orbit the sun which is counter-clockwise as seen from above the sun's north pole the exceptions are venus[] and uranus[] which rotate clockwise though uranus's extreme axial tilt means there are differing conventions on which of its poles is "north" and therefore whether it is rotating clockwise or anti-clockwise[] regardless of which convention is used uranus has a retrograde rotation relative to its orbit[]
comparison of the rotation period (sped up   times negative values denoting retrograde) flattening and axial tilt of the planets and the moon (svg animation)
the rotation of a planet can be induced by several factors during formation a net angular momentum can be induced by the individual angular momentum contributions of accreted objects the accretion of gas by the giant planets contributes to the angular momentum finally during the last stages of planet building a stochastic process of protoplanetary accretion can randomly alter the spin axis of the planet[] there is great variation in the length of day between the planets with venus taking  days to rotate and the giant planets only a few hours[] the rotational periods of extrasolar planets are not known but for hot jupiters their proximity to their stars means that they are tidally locked (that is their orbits are in sync with their rotations) this means they always show one face to their stars with one side in perpetual day the other in perpetual night[] mercury and venus the closest planets to the sun similarly exhibit very slow rotation: mercury is tidally locked into a : spin–orbit resonance (rotating three times for every two revolutions around the sun)[] and venus' rotation may be in equilibrium between tidal forces slowing it down and atmospheric tides created by solar heating speeding it up[][]
all the large moons are tidally locked to their parent planets;[] pluto and charon are tidally locked to each other[] as are eris and dysnomia[] orcus and its moon vanth may be another example of mutual tidal locking but the data is not conclusive[] the other dwarf planets with known rotation periods rotate faster than earth; haumea rotates so fast that it has been distorted into a triaxial ellipsoid[] the exoplanet tau boötis b and its parent star tau boötis appear to be mutually tidally locked[][]
orbital clearing
main article: clearing the neighbourhood
the defining dynamic characteristic of a planet according to the iau definition is that it has cleared its neighborhood a planet that has cleared its neighborhood has accumulated enough mass to gather up or sweep away all the planetesimals in its orbit in effect it orbits its star in isolation as opposed to sharing its orbit with a multitude of similar-sized objects as described above this characteristic was mandated as part of the iau's official definition of a planet in august [] although to date this criterion only applies to the solar system a number of young extrasolar systems have been found in which evidence suggests orbital clearing is taking place within their circumstellar discs[]
physical characteristics
size and shape
see also: earth § size and shape astronomical body § size and planetary coordinate system
gravity causes planets to be pulled into a roughly spherical shape so a planet's size can be expressed roughly by an average radius (for example earth radius or jupiter radius) however planets are not perfectly spherical; for example the earth's rotation causes it to be slightly flattened at the poles with a bulge around the equator[] therefore a better approximation of earth's shape is an oblate spheroid whose equatorial diameter is  kilometers ( mi) larger than the pole-to-pole diameter[] generally a planet's shape may be described by giving polar and equatorial radii of a spheroid or specifying a reference ellipsoid from such a specification the planet's flattening surface area and volume can be calculated; its normal gravity can be computed knowing its size shape rotation rate and mass[]
mass
main article: planetary mass
a planet's defining physical characteristic is that it is massive enough for the force of its own gravity to dominate over the electromagnetic forces binding its physical structure leading to a state of hydrostatic equilibrium this effectively means that all planets are spherical or spheroidal up to a certain mass an object can be irregular in shape but beyond that point which varies depending on the chemical makeup of the object gravity begins to pull an object towards its own centre of mass until the object collapses into a sphere[]
mass is the prime attribute by which planets are distinguished from stars while the lower stellar mass limit is estimated to be around  times that of jupiter (mj) the upper planetary mass limit for planethood is only roughly  mj for objects with solar-type isotopic abundance beyond which it achieves conditions suitable for nuclear fusion of deuterium other than the sun no objects of such mass exist in the solar system; but there are exoplanets of this size the  mj limit is not universally agreed upon and the extrasolar planets encyclopaedia includes objects up to  mj[] and the exoplanet data explorer up to  mj[] the mass-radius relationship does not change appreciably with the onset of deuterium fusion with radius remaining roughly constant as mass increases from one saturn mass (beginning of significant self-compression) to about  m (around  mj the onset of hydrogen burning and becoming a red dwarf) and thus some authors argue that brown dwarfs should be considered as high-mass jovian planets[]
the smallest known exoplanet with an accurately known mass is psr b+a one of the first extrasolar planets discovered which was found in  in orbit around a pulsar its mass is roughly half that of the planet mercury[] even smaller is wd + b orbiting a white dwarf; its mass is roughly that of the dwarf planet haumea and it is typically termed a minor planet[] the smallest known planet orbiting a main-sequence star other than the sun is kepler-b with a mass (and radius) that is probably slightly higher than that of the moon[] the smallest object in the solar system generally agreed to be a geophysical planet is saturn's moon mimas with a radius about  of earth's and a mass about  of earth's[] saturn's smaller moon phoebe currently an irregular body of  earth's radius[] and  earth's mass[] is thought to have attained hydrostatic equilibrium and differentiation early in its history before being battered out of shape by impacts[] some asteroids may be fragments of protoplanets that began to accrete and differentiate but suffered catastrophic collisions leaving only a metallic or rocky core today[][][] or a reaccumulation of the resulting debris[]
internal differentiation
main article: planetary differentiation
illustration of the interior of jupiter with a rocky core overlaid by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen
every planet began its existence in an entirely fluid state; in early formation the denser heavier materials sank to the centre leaving the lighter materials near the surface each therefore has a differentiated interior consisting of a dense planetary core surrounded by a mantle that either is or was a fluid the terrestrial planets' mantles are sealed within hard crusts[] but in the giant planets the mantle simply blends into the upper cloud layers the terrestrial planets have cores of elements such as iron and nickel and mantles of silicates jupiter and saturn are believed to have cores of rock and metal surrounded by mantles of metallic hydrogen[] uranus and neptune which are smaller have rocky cores surrounded by mantles of water ammonia methane and other ices[] the fluid action within these planets' cores creates a geodynamo that generates a magnetic field[] similar differentiation processes are believed to have occurred on some of the large moons and dwarf planets[] though the process may not always have been completed: ceres callisto and titan appear to be incompletely differentiated[][] the asteroid vesta though not a dwarf planet because it was battered by impacts out of roundness has a differentiated interior[] similar to that of venus earth and mars[]
atmosphere

earth's atmosphere
all of the solar system planets except mercury[] have substantial atmospheres because their gravity is strong enough to keep gases close to the surface saturn's largest moon titan also has a substantial atmosphere thicker than that of earth;[] neptune's largest moon triton[] and the dwarf planet pluto have more tenuous atmospheres[] the larger giant planets are massive enough to keep large amounts of the light gases hydrogen and helium whereas the smaller planets lose these gases into space[] analysis of exoplanets suggests that the threshold for being able to hold on to these light gases occurs at about +
− m so that earth and venus are near the maximum size for rocky planets[]
the composition of earth's atmosphere is different from the other planets because the various life processes that have transpired on the planet have introduced free molecular oxygen[] the atmospheres of mars and venus are both dominated by carbon dioxide but differ drastically in density: the average surface pressure of mars' atmosphere is less than  that of earth's (too low to allow liquid water to exist)[] while the average surface pressure of venus' atmosphere is about  times that of earth's[] it is likely that venus' atmosphere was the result of a runaway greenhouse effect in its history which today makes it the hottest planet by surface temperature hotter even than mercury[] despite hostile surface conditions temperature and pressure at about – km altitude in venus' atmosphere are close to earthlike conditions (the only place in the solar system beyond earth where this is so) and this region has been suggested as a plausible base for future human exploration[] titan has the only nitrogen-rich planetary atmosphere in the solar system other than earth's just as earth's conditions are close to the triple point of water allowing it to exist in all three states on the planet's surface so titan's are to the triple point of methane[]
planetary atmospheres are affected by the varying insolation or internal energy leading to the formation of dynamic weather systems such as hurricanes (on earth) planet-wide dust storms (on mars) a greater-than-earth-sized anticyclone on jupiter (called the great red spot) and holes in the atmosphere (on neptune)[] weather patterns detected on exoplanets include a hot region on hd  b twice the size of the great red spot[] as well as clouds on the hot jupiter kepler-b[] the super-earth gliese  b and others[][]
hot jupiters due to their extreme proximities to their host stars have been shown to be losing their atmospheres into space due to stellar radiation much like the tails of comets[][] these planets may have vast differences in temperature between their day and night sides that produce supersonic winds[] although multiple factors are involved and the details of the atmospheric dynamics that affect the day-night temperature difference are complex[][]
magnetosphere
main article: magnetosphere
earth's magnetosphere (diagram)
one important characteristic of the planets is their intrinsic magnetic moments which in turn give rise to magnetospheres the presence of a magnetic field indicates that the planet is still geologically alive in other words magnetized planets have flows of electrically conducting material in their interiors which generate their magnetic fields these fields significantly change the interaction of the planet and solar wind a magnetized planet creates a cavity in the solar wind around itself called the magnetosphere which the wind cannot penetrate the magnetosphere can be much larger than the planet itself in contrast non-magnetized planets have only small magnetospheres induced by interaction of the ionosphere with the solar wind which cannot effectively protect the planet[]
of the eight planets in the solar system only venus and mars lack such a magnetic field[] of the magnetized planets the magnetic field of mercury is the weakest and is barely able to deflect the solar wind jupiter's moon ganymede has a magnetic field several times stronger and jupiter's is the strongest in the solar system (so intense in fact that it poses a serious health risk to future crewed missions to all its moons inward of callisto[]) the magnetic fields of the other giant planets measured at their surfaces are roughly similar in strength to that of earth but their magnetic moments are significantly larger the magnetic fields of uranus and neptune are strongly tilted relative to the planets' rotational axes and displaced from the planets' centres[]

secondary characteristics
main articles: natural satellite and planetary ring
the rings of saturn
several planets or dwarf planets in the solar system (such as neptune and pluto) have orbital periods that are in resonance with each other or with smaller bodies this is common in satellite systems (eg the resonance between io europa and ganymede around jupiter or between enceladus and dione around saturn) all except mercury and venus have natural satellites often called "moons" earth has one mars has two and the giant planets have numerous moons in complex planetary-type systems except for ceres and sedna all the consensus dwarf planets are known to have at least one moon as well many moons of the giant planets have features similar to those on the terrestrial planets and dwarf planets and some have been studied as possible abodes of life (especially europa and enceladus)[][][][][]
the four giant planets are orbited by planetary rings of varying size and complexity the rings are composed primarily of dust or particulate matter but can host tiny 'moonlets' whose gravity shapes and maintains their structure although the origins of planetary rings is not precisely known they are believed to be the result of natural satellites that fell below their parent planet's roche limit and were torn apart by tidal forces[][] the dwarf planets haumea[] and quaoar also have rings[]
no secondary characteristics have been observed around extrasolar planets the sub-brown dwarf cha - which has been described as a rogue planet is believed to be orbited by a tiny protoplanetary disc[] and the sub-brown dwarf ots  was shown to be surrounded by a substantial protoplanetary disk of at least  earth masses[]
a planetary system is a set of gravitationally bound non-stellar objects in or out of orbit around a star or star system generally speaking systems with one or more planets constitute a planetary system although such systems may also consist of bodies such as dwarf planets asteroids natural satellites meteoroids comets planetesimals[][] and circumstellar disks the sun together with the planetary system revolving around it including earth forms the solar system[][] the term exoplanetary system is sometimes used in reference to other planetary systems
as of  september  there are  confirmed exoplanets in  planetary systems with  systems having more than one planet[] debris disks are also known to be common though other objects are more difficult to observe
of particular interest to astrobiology is the habitable zone of planetary systems where planets could have surface liquid water and thus the capacity to support earth-like life
history
heliocentrism
historically heliocentrism (the doctrine that the sun is at the centre of the universe) was opposed to geocentrism (placing earth at the centre of the universe)
the notion of a heliocentric solar system with the sun at its centre is possibly first suggested in the vedic literature of ancient india which often refer to the sun as the "centre of spheres" some interpret aryabhatta's writings in āryabhaṭīya as implicitly heliocentric
the idea was first proposed in western philosophy and greek astronomy as early as the rd century bc by aristarchus of samos[] but received no support from most other ancient astronomers
discovery of the solar system

heliocentric model of the solar system in copernicus' manuscript
de revolutionibus orbium coelestium by nicolaus copernicus published in  presented the first mathematically predictive heliocentric model of a planetary system th-century successors galileo galilei johannes kepler and sir isaac newton developed an understanding of physics which led to the gradual acceptance of the idea that the earth moves around the sun and that the planets are governed by the same physical laws that governed earth
speculation on extrasolar planetary systems
in the th century the italian philosopher giordano bruno an early supporter of the copernican theory that earth and other planets orbit the sun put forward the view that the fixed stars are similar to the sun and are likewise accompanied by planets he was burned at the stake for his ideas by the roman inquisition[]
in the th century the same possibility was mentioned by sir isaac newton in the "general scholium" that concludes his principia making a comparison to the sun's planets he wrote "and if the fixed stars are the centres of similar systems they will all be constructed according to a similar design and subject to the dominion of one"[]
his theories gained traction[colloquialism] through the th and th centuries despite a lack of supporting evidence long before their confirmation by astronomers conjecture on the nature of planetary systems had been a focus of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence and has been a prevalent theme in fiction particularly science fiction
detection of exoplanets
the first confirmed detection of an exoplanet was in  with the discovery of several terrestrial-mass planets orbiting the pulsar psr b+ the first confirmed detection of exoplanets of a main-sequence star was made in  when a giant planet  pegasi b was found in a four-day orbit around the nearby g-type star  pegasi the frequency of detections has increased since then particularly through advancements in methods of detecting extrasolar planets and dedicated planet finding programs such as the kepler mission
origin and evolution

illustration of the dynamics of a proplyd
planetary systems come from protoplanetary disks that form around stars as part of the process of star formation
during formation of a system much material is gravitationally-scattered into distant orbits and some planets are ejected completely from the system becoming rogue planets
evolved systems
high-mass stars
planets orbiting pulsars have been discovered pulsars are the remnants of the supernova explosions of high-mass stars but a planetary system that existed before the supernova would likely be mostly destroyed planets would either evaporate be pushed off of their orbits by the masses of gas from the exploding star or the sudden loss of most of the mass of the central star would see them escape the gravitational hold of the star or in some cases the supernova would kick the pulsar itself out of the system at high velocity so any planets that had survived the explosion would be left behind as free-floating objects planets found around pulsars may have formed as a result of pre-existing stellar companions that were almost entirely evaporated by the supernova blast leaving behind planet-sized bodies alternatively planets may form in an accretion disk of fallback matter surrounding a pulsar[] fallback disks of matter that failed to escape orbit during a supernova may also form planets around black holes[]
lower-mass stars
protoplanetary discs observed with the very large telescope[]
as stars evolve and turn into red giants asymptotic giant branch stars and planetary nebulae they engulf the inner planets evaporating or partially evaporating them depending on how massive they are[][] as the star loses mass planets that are not engulfed move further out from the star
if an evolved star is in a binary or multiple system then the mass it loses can transfer to another star forming new protoplanetary disks and second- and third-generation planets which may differ in composition from the original planets which may also be affected by the mass transfer
system architectures
the solar system consists of an inner region of small rocky planets and outer region of large gas giants however other planetary systems can have quite different architectures studies suggest that architectures of planetary systems are dependent on the conditions of their initial formation[] many systems with a hot jupiter gas giant very close to the star have been found theories such as planetary migration or scattering have been proposed for the formation of large planets close to their parent stars[] at present[when] few systems have been found to be analogous to the solar system with terrestrial planets close to the parent star more commonly systems consisting of multiple super-earths have been detected[]
classification
planetary system architectures may be partitioned into four classes based on how the mass of the planets is distributed around the host star:[][]
similar: the masses of all planets in a system are similar to each other this architecture class is the most commonly-observed in our galaxy examples include trappist- the planets in these systems are said to be like 'peas in a pod'[]
mixed: the masses of planets in a system show large increasing or decreasing variations example of such systems are: gj- or the kepler- system
anti-ordered: the massive planets of a system are close to the star and smaller planets are further away from the star there are currently no known examples of this architecture class
ordered: the mass of the planets in a system tends to increase with increasing distance from the host star the solar system with small rocky planets in the inner part and giant planets in the outer part is a type of ordered system
components
planets and stars
main article: planet-hosting stars
the morgan-keenan spectral classification
most known exoplanets orbit stars roughly similar to the sun: that is main-sequence stars of spectral categories f g or k one reason is that planet-search programs have tended to concentrate on such stars in addition statistical analyses indicate that lower-mass stars (red dwarfs of spectral category m) are less likely to have planets massive enough to be detected by the radial-velocity method[][] nevertheless several tens of planets around red dwarfs have been discovered by the kepler spacecraft by the transit method which can detect smaller planets
circumstellar disks and dust structures
main article: circumstellar disk
debris disks detected in hst archival images of young stars hd  and hd  using improved imaging processes (april  )
after planets circumstellar disks are one of the most commonly-observed properties of planetary systems particularly of young stars the solar system possesses at least four major circumstellar disks (the asteroid belt kuiper belt scattered disc and oort cloud) and clearly-observable disks have been detected around nearby solar analogs including epsilon eridani and tau ceti based on observations of numerous similar disks they are assumed to be quite common attributes of stars on the main sequence
interplanetary dust clouds have been studied in the solar system and analogs are believed to be present in other planetary systems exozodiacal dust an exoplanetary analog of zodiacal dust the – micrometre-sized grains of amorphous carbon and silicate dust that fill the plane of the solar system[] has been detected around the  ophiuchi fomalhaut[][] tau ceti[][] and vega systems

computer modelling of an impact in  detected around the star ngc -id by the spitzer space telescope and confirmed by ground observations suggests the involvement of large asteroids or protoplanets similar to the events believed to have led to the formation of terrestrial planets like the earth[]
based on observations of the solar system's large collection of natural satellites they are believed common components of planetary systems; however the existence of exomoons has so far[when] not been confirmed the star swasp j- in the constellation centaurus is a strong candidate for a natural satellite[] indications suggest that the confirmed extrasolar planet wasp-b also has at least one satellite[]
orbital configurations
unlike the solar system which has orbits that are nearly circular many of the known planetary systems display much higher orbital eccentricity[] an example of such a system is  cygni
mutual inclination
the mutual inclination between two planets is the angle between their orbital planes many compact systems with multiple close-in planets interior to the equivalent orbit of venus are expected to have very low mutual inclinations so the system (at least the close-in part) would be even flatter than the solar system captured planets could be captured into any arbitrary angle to the rest of the system as of  there are only a few systems where mutual inclinations have actually been measured[] one example is the upsilon andromedae system: the planets c and d have a mutual inclination of about  degrees[][]
orbital dynamics
planetary systems can be categorized according to their orbital dynamics as resonant non-resonant-interacting hierarchical or some combination of these in resonant systems the orbital periods of the planets are in integer ratios the kepler- system contains four planets in an ::: orbital resonance[] giant planets are found in mean-motion resonances more often than smaller planets[] in interacting systems the planets orbits are close enough together that they perturb the orbital parameters the solar system could be described as weakly interacting in strongly interacting systems kepler's laws do not hold[] in hierarchical systems the planets are arranged so that the system can be gravitationally considered as a nested system of two-bodies eg in a star with a close-in hot jupiter with another gas giant much further out the star and hot jupiter form a pair that appears as a single object to another planet that is far enough out
other as yet unobserved orbital possibilities include: double planets; various co-orbital planets such as quasi-satellites trojans and exchange orbits; and interlocking orbits maintained by precessing orbital planes[]

planet capture
free-floating planets in open clusters have similar velocities to the stars and so can be recaptured they are typically captured into wide orbits between  and  au the capture efficiency decreases with increasing cluster size and for a given cluster size it increases with the host/primary[clarification needed] mass it is almost independent of the planetary mass single and multiple planets could be captured into arbitrary unaligned orbits non-coplanar with each other or with the stellar host spin or pre-existing planetary system some planet–host metallicity correlation may still exist due to the common origin of the stars from the same cluster planets would be unlikely to be captured around neutron stars because these are likely to be ejected from the cluster by a pulsar kick when they form planets could even be captured around other planets to form free-floating planet binaries after the cluster has dispersed some of the captured planets with orbits larger than  au would be slowly disrupted by the galactic tide and likely become free-floating again through encounters with other field stars or giant molecular clouds[]
zones
habitable zone
main article: circumstellar habitable zone
location of habitable zone around different types of stars
the habitable zone around a star is the region where the temperature range allows for liquid water to exist on a planet; that is not too close to the star for the water to evaporate and not too far away from the star for the water to freeze the heat produced by stars varies depending on the size and age of the star; this means the habitable zone will also vary accordingly also the atmospheric conditions on the planet influence the planet's ability to retain heat so that the location of the habitable zone is also specific to each type of planet
habitable zones have usually been defined in terms of surface temperature; however over half of earth's biomass is from subsurface microbes[] and temperature increases as depth underground increases so the subsurface can be conducive for life when the surface is frozen; if this is considered the habitable zone extends much further from the star[]
studies in  indicated an estimated frequency of ± of sun-like[a] stars having an earth-sized[b] planet in the habitable[c] zone[][]
venus zone
the venus zone is the region around a star where a terrestrial planet would have runaway greenhouse conditions like venus but not so near the star that the atmosphere completely evaporates as with the habitable zone the location of the venus zone depends on several factors including the type of star and properties of the planets such as mass rotation rate and atmospheric clouds studies of the kepler spacecraft data indicate that  of red dwarfs have potentially venus-like planets based on planet size and distance from star increasing to  for k-type and g-type stars[d] several candidates have been identified but spectroscopic follow-up studies of their atmospheres are required to determine whether they are like venus[][]

 of planets with known distances are within about  light years of earth as of july 
the milky way is  light-years across but  of planets with known distances are within about  light years of earth as of july  one method that can detect planets much further away is microlensing the upcoming nancy grace roman space telescope could use microlensing to measure the relative frequency of planets in the galactic bulge versus the galactic disk[] so far the indications are that planets are more common in the disk than the bulge[] estimates of the distance of microlensing events is difficult: the first planet considered with high probability of being in the bulge is moa--blg-lb at a distance of  kiloparsecs (about  light years)[]
population i or metal-rich stars are those young stars whose metallicity is highest the high metallicity of population i stars makes them more likely to possess planetary systems than older populations because planets form by the accretion of metals[citation needed] the sun is an example of a metal-rich star these are common in the spiral arms of the milky way[citation needed] generally the youngest stars the extreme population i are found farther in and intermediate population i stars are farther out etc the sun is considered an intermediate population i star population i stars have regular elliptical orbits around the galactic center with a low relative velocity[]
population ii or metal-poor stars are those with relatively low metallicity which can have hundreds (eg bd +° ) or thousands (eg sneden's star) times less metallicity than the sun these objects formed during an earlier time of the universe[citation needed] intermediate population ii stars are common in the bulge near the center of the milky way[citation needed] whereas population ii stars found in the galactic halo are older and thus more metal-poor[citation needed] globular clusters also contain high numbers of population ii stars[] in  the first planets around a halo star were announced around kapteyn's star the nearest halo star to earth around  light years away however later research suggests that kapteyn b is just an artefact of stellar activity and that kapteyn c needs more study to be confirmed[] the metallicity of kapteyn's star is estimated to be about [e] times less than the sun[]
different types of galaxies have different histories of star formation and hence planet formation planet formation is affected by the ages metallicities and orbits of stellar populations within a galaxy distribution of stellar populations within a galaxy varies between the different types of galaxies[] stars in elliptical galaxies are much older than stars in spiral galaxies most elliptical galaxies contain mainly low-mass stars with minimal star-formation activity[] the distribution of the different types of galaxies in the universe depends on their location within galaxy clusters with elliptical galaxies found mostly close to their centers[]
a supercomputer is a computer with a high level of performance as compared to a general-purpose computer the performance of a supercomputer is commonly measured in floating-point operations per second (flops) instead of million instructions per second (mips) since  there have existed supercomputers which can perform over  flops (a hundred quadrillion flops  petaflops or  pflops)[] for comparison a desktop computer has performance in the range of hundreds of gigaflops () to tens of teraflops ()[][] since november  all of the world's fastest  supercomputers run on linux-based operating systems[] additional research is being conducted in the united states the european union taiwan japan and china to build faster more powerful and technologically superior exascale supercomputers[]
supercomputers play an important role in the field of computational science and are used for a wide range of computationally intensive tasks in various fields including quantum mechanics weather forecasting climate research oil and gas exploration molecular modeling (computing the structures and properties of chemical compounds biological macromolecules polymers and crystals) and physical simulations (such as simulations of the early moments of the universe airplane and spacecraft aerodynamics the detonation of nuclear weapons and nuclear fusion) they have been essential in the field of cryptanalysis[]
supercomputers were introduced in the s and for several decades the fastest was made by seymour cray at control data corporation (cdc) cray research and subsequent companies bearing his name or monogram the first such machines were highly tuned conventional designs that ran more quickly than their more general-purpose contemporaries through the decade increasing amounts of parallelism were added with one to four processors being typical in the s vector processors operating on large arrays of data came to dominate a notable example is the highly successful cray- of  vector computers remained the dominant design into the s from then until today massively parallel supercomputers with tens of thousands of off-the-shelf processors became the norm[][]
the us has long been the leader in the supercomputer field first through cray's almost uninterrupted dominance of the field and later through a variety of technology companies japan made major strides in the field in the s and s with china becoming increasingly active in the field as of may  the fastest supercomputer on the top supercomputer list is frontier in the us with a linpack benchmark score of  exaflop/s followed by fugaku[] the us has five of the top ; china has two; japan finland and france have one each[] in june  all combined supercomputers on the top list broke the  exaflops mark[]

in  univac built the livermore atomic research computer (larc) today considered among the first supercomputers for the us navy research and development center it still used high-speed drum memory rather than the newly emerging disk drive technology[] also among the first supercomputers was the ibm  stretch the ibm  was built by ibm for the los alamos national laboratory which in  had requested a computer  times faster than any existing computer the ibm  used transistors magnetic core memory pipelined instructions prefetched data through a memory controller and included pioneering random access disk drives the ibm  was completed in  and despite not meeting the challenge of a hundredfold increase in performance it was purchased by the los alamos national laboratory customers in england and france also bought the computer and it became the basis for the ibm  harvest a supercomputer built for cryptanalysis[]
the third pioneering supercomputer project in the early s was the atlas at the university of manchester built by a team led by tom kilburn he designed the atlas to have memory space for up to a million words of  bits but because magnetic storage with such a capacity was unaffordable the actual core memory of the atlas was only  words with a drum providing memory for a further  words the atlas operating system swapped data in the form of pages between the magnetic core and the drum the atlas operating system also introduced time-sharing to supercomputing so that more than one program could be executed on the supercomputer at any one time[] atlas was a joint venture between ferranti and manchester university and was designed to operate at processing speeds approaching one microsecond per instruction about one million instructions per second[]
the cdc  designed by seymour cray was finished in  and marked the transition from germanium to silicon transistors silicon transistors could run more quickly and the overheating problem was solved by introducing refrigeration to the supercomputer design[] thus the cdc became the fastest computer in the world given that the  outperformed all the other contemporary computers by about  times it was dubbed a supercomputer and defined the supercomputing market when one hundred computers were sold at  million each[][][][]
cray left cdc in  to form his own company cray research[] four years after leaving cdc cray delivered the  mhz cray- in  which became one of the most successful supercomputers in history[][] the cray- was released in  it had eight central processing units (cpus) liquid cooling and the electronics coolant liquid fluorinert was pumped through the supercomputer architecture it reached  gigaflops making it the first supercomputer to break the gigaflop barrier[]
massively parallel designs
main articles: supercomputer architecture and parallel computer hardware
a cabinet of the massively parallel blue gene/l showing the stacked blades each holding many processors
the only computer to seriously challenge the cray-'s performance in the s was the illiac iv this machine was the first realized example of a true massively parallel computer in which many processors worked together to solve different parts of a single larger problem in contrast with the vector systems which were designed to run a single stream of data as quickly as possible in this concept the computer instead feeds separate parts of the data to entirely different processors and then recombines the results the illiac's design was finalized in  with  processors and offer speed up to  gflops compared to the s cray-'s peak of  mflops however development problems led to only  processors being built and the system could never operate more quickly than about  mflops while being much larger and more complex than the cray another problem was that writing software for the system was difficult and getting peak performance from it was a matter of serious effort
but the partial success of the illiac iv was widely seen as pointing the way to the future of supercomputing cray argued against this famously quipping that "if you were plowing a field which would you rather use two strong oxen or  chickens"[] but by the early s several teams were working on parallel designs with thousands of processors notably the connection machine (cm) that developed from research at mit the cm- used as many as  simplified custom microprocessors connected together in a network to share data several updated versions followed; the cm- supercomputer is a massively parallel processing computer capable of many billions of arithmetic operations per second[]
in  osaka university's links- computer graphics system used a massively parallel processing architecture with  microprocessors including  zilog z control processors and  iapx / floating-point processors it was mainly used for rendering realistic d computer graphics[] fujitsu's vpp from  is unusual since to achieve higher speeds its processors used gaas a material normally reserved for microwave applications due to its toxicity[] fujitsu's numerical wind tunnel supercomputer used  vector processors to gain the top spot in  with a peak speed of  gigaflops (gflops) per processor[][] the hitachi sr obtained a peak performance of  gflops in  by using  processors connected via a fast three-dimensional crossbar network[][][] the intel paragon could have  to  intel i processors in various configurations and was ranked the fastest in the world in  the paragon was a mimd machine which connected processors via a high speed two-dimensional mesh allowing processes to execute on separate nodes communicating via the message passing interface[]
software development remained a problem but the cm series sparked off considerable research into this issue similar designs using custom hardware were made by many companies including the evans & sutherland es- maspar ncube intel ipsc and the goodyear mpp but by the mid-s general-purpose cpu performance had improved so much in that a supercomputer could be built using them as the individual processing units instead of using custom chips by the turn of the st century designs featuring tens of thousands of commodity cpus were the norm with later machines adding graphic units to the mix[][]

diagram of a three-dimensional torus interconnect used by systems such as blue gene cray xt etc
systems with a massive number of processors generally take one of two paths in the grid computing approach the processing power of many computers organized as distributed diverse administrative domains is opportunistically used whenever a computer is available[] in another approach many processors are used in proximity to each other eg in a computer cluster in such a centralized massively parallel system the speed and flexibility of the interconnect becomes very important and modern supercomputers have used various approaches ranging from enhanced infiniband systems to three-dimensional torus interconnects[][] the use of multi-core processors combined with centralization is an emerging direction eg as in the cyclops system[][]
as the price performance and energy efficiency of general-purpose graphics processing units (gpgpus) have improved a number of petaflops supercomputers such as tianhe-i and nebulae have started to rely on them[] however other systems such as the k computer continue to use conventional processors such as sparc-based designs and the overall applicability of gpgpus in general-purpose high-performance computing applications has been the subject of debate in that while a gpgpu may be tuned to score well on specific benchmarks its overall applicability to everyday algorithms may be limited unless significant effort is spent to tune the application to it[] however gpus are gaining ground and in  the jaguar supercomputer was transformed into titan by retrofitting cpus with gpus[][][]
high-performance computers have an expected life cycle of about three years before requiring an upgrade[] the gyoukou supercomputer is unique in that it uses both a massively parallel design and liquid immersion cooling
special purpose supercomputers
a number of special-purpose systems have been designed dedicated to a single problem this allows the use of specially programmed fpga chips or even custom asics allowing better price/performance ratios by sacrificing generality examples of special-purpose supercomputers include belle[] deep blue[] and hydra[] for playing chess gravity pipe for astrophysics[] mdgrape- for protein structure prediction and molecular dynamics[] and deep crack for breaking the des cipher[]

the summit supercomputer was as of november  the fastest supercomputer in the world[] with a measured power efficiency of  gflops/watt it is also the third most energy efficient in the world[]
throughout the decades the management of heat density has remained a key issue for most centralized supercomputers[][][] the large amount of heat generated by a system may also have other effects eg reducing the lifetime of other system components[] there have been diverse approaches to heat management from pumping fluorinert through the system to a hybrid liquid-air cooling system or air cooling with normal air conditioning temperatures[][] a typical supercomputer consumes large amounts of electrical power almost all of which is converted into heat requiring cooling for example tianhe-a consumes  megawatts (mw) of electricity[] the cost to power and cool the system can be significant eg  mw at /kwh is  an hour or about  million per year

heat management is a major issue in complex electronic devices and affects powerful computer systems in various ways[] the thermal design power and cpu power dissipation issues in supercomputing surpass those of traditional computer cooling technologies the supercomputing awards for green computing reflect this issue[][][]
the packing of thousands of processors together inevitably generates significant amounts of heat density that need to be dealt with the cray- was liquid cooled and used a fluorinert "cooling waterfall" which was forced through the modules under pressure[] however the submerged liquid cooling approach was not practical for the multi-cabinet systems based on off-the-shelf processors and in system x a special cooling system that combined air conditioning with liquid cooling was developed in conjunction with the liebert company[]
in the blue gene system ibm deliberately used low power processors to deal with heat density[] the ibm power  released in  has closely packed elements that require water cooling[] the ibm aquasar system uses hot water cooling to achieve energy efficiency the water being used to heat buildings as well[][]
the energy efficiency of computer systems is generally measured in terms of "flops per watt" in  roadrunner by ibm operated at  mflops/w[][] in november  the blue gene/q reached  mflops/w[][] and in june  the top two spots on the green  list were occupied by blue gene machines in new york (one achieving  mflops/w) with the degima cluster in nagasaki placing third with  mflops/w[]
because copper wires can transfer energy into a supercomputer with much higher power densities than forced air or circulating refrigerants can remove waste heat[] the ability of the cooling systems to remove waste heat is a limiting factor[][] as of  many existing supercomputers have more infrastructure capacity than the actual peak demand of the machine – designers generally conservatively design the power and cooling infrastructure to handle more than the theoretical peak electrical power consumed by the supercomputer designs for future supercomputers are power-limited – the thermal design power of the supercomputer as a whole the amount that the power and cooling infrastructure can handle is somewhat more than the expected normal power consumption but less than the theoretical peak power consumption of the electronic hardware[]
software and system management
operating systems
main article: supercomputer operating systems
since the end of the th century supercomputer operating systems have undergone major transformations based on the changes in supercomputer architecture[] while early operating systems were custom tailored to each supercomputer to gain speed the trend has been to move away from in-house operating systems to the adaptation of generic software such as linux[]
since modern massively parallel supercomputers typically separate computations from other services by using multiple types of nodes they usually run different operating systems on different nodes eg using a small and efficient lightweight kernel such as cnk or cnl on compute nodes but a larger system such as a linux-derivative on server and i/o nodes[][][]
while in a traditional multi-user computer system job scheduling is in effect a tasking problem for processing and peripheral resources in a massively parallel system the job management system needs to manage the allocation of both computational and communication resources as well as gracefully deal with inevitable hardware failures when tens of thousands of processors are present[]
although most modern supercomputers use linux-based operating systems each manufacturer has its own specific linux-derivative and no industry standard exists partly due to the fact that the differences in hardware architectures require changes to optimize the operating system to each hardware design[][]

the parallel architectures of supercomputers often dictate the use of special programming techniques to exploit their speed software tools for distributed processing include standard apis such as mpi[] and pvm vtl and open source software such as beowulf
in the most common scenario environments such as pvm and mpi for loosely connected clusters and openmp for tightly coordinated shared memory machines are used significant effort is required to optimize an algorithm for the interconnect characteristics of the machine it will be run on; the aim is to prevent any of the cpus from wasting time waiting on data from other nodes gpgpus have hundreds of processor cores and are programmed using programming models such as cuda or opencl
moreover it is quite difficult to debug and test parallel programs special techniques need to be used for testing and debugging such applications

opportunistic supercomputing is a form of networked grid computing whereby a "super virtual computer" of many loosely coupled volunteer computing machines performs very large computing tasks grid computing has been applied to a number of large-scale embarrassingly parallel problems that require supercomputing performance scales however basic grid and cloud computing approaches that rely on volunteer computing cannot handle traditional supercomputing tasks such as fluid dynamic simulations[]

quasi-opportunistic supercomputing is a form of distributed computing whereby the "super virtual computer" of many networked geographically disperse computers performs computing tasks that demand huge processing power[] quasi-opportunistic supercomputing aims to provide a higher quality of service than opportunistic grid computing by achieving more control over the assignment of tasks to distributed resources and the use of intelligence about the availability and reliability of individual systems within the supercomputing network however quasi-opportunistic distributed execution of demanding parallel computing software in grids should be achieved through the implementation of grid-wise allocation agreements co-allocation subsystems communication topology-aware allocation mechanisms fault tolerant message passing libraries and data pre-conditioning[]
high-performance computing clouds
cloud computing with its recent and rapid expansions and development have grabbed the attention of high-performance computing (hpc) users and developers in recent years cloud computing attempts to provide hpc-as-a-service exactly like other forms of services available in the cloud such as software as a service platform as a service and infrastructure as a service hpc users may benefit from the cloud in different angles such as scalability resources being on-demand fast and inexpensive on the other hand moving hpc applications have a set of challenges too good examples of such challenges are virtualization overhead in the cloud multi-tenancy of resources and network latency issues much research is currently being done to overcome these challenges and make hpc in the cloud a more realistic possibility[][][][]

performance measurement
capability versus capacity
supercomputers generally aim for the maximum in capability computing rather than capacity computing capability computing is typically thought of as using the maximum computing power to solve a single large problem in the shortest amount of time often a capability system is able to solve a problem of a size or complexity that no other computer can eg a very complex weather simulation application[]
capacity computing in contrast is typically thought of as using efficient cost-effective computing power to solve a few somewhat large problems or many small problems[] architectures that lend themselves to supporting many users for routine everyday tasks may have a lot of capacity but are not typically considered supercomputers given that they do not solve a single very complex problem[]
performance metrics

top supercomputer speeds: logscale speed over  years
in general the speed of supercomputers is measured and benchmarked in flops (floating-point operations per second) and not in terms of mips (million instructions per second) as is the case with general-purpose computers[] these measurements are commonly used with an si prefix such as tera- combined into the shorthand tflops ( flops pronounced teraflops) or peta- combined into the shorthand pflops ( flops pronounced petaflops) petascale supercomputers can process one quadrillion () ( trillion) flops exascale is computing performance in the exaflops (eflops) range an eflops is one quintillion () flops (one million tflops) however the performance of a supercomputer can be severely impacted by fluctuation brought on by elements like system load network traffic and concurrent processes as mentioned by brehm and bruhwiler () []
no single number can reflect the overall performance of a computer system yet the goal of the linpack benchmark is to approximate how fast the computer solves numerical problems and it is widely used in the industry[] the flops measurement is either quoted based on the theoretical floating point performance of a processor (derived from manufacturer's processor specifications and shown as "rpeak" in the top lists) which is generally unachievable when running real workloads or the achievable throughput derived from the linpack benchmarks and shown as "rmax" in the top list[] the linpack benchmark typically performs lu decomposition of a large matrix[] the linpack performance gives some indication of performance for some real-world problems but does not necessarily match the processing requirements of many other supercomputer workloads which for example may require more memory bandwidth or may require better integer computing performance or may need a high performance i/o system to achieve high levels of performance[]

top  supercomputers in the world (june )
since  the fastest supercomputers have been ranked on the top list according to their linpack benchmark results the list does not claim to be unbiased or definitive but it is a widely cited current definition of the "fastest" supercomputer available at any given time
this is a recent list of the computers which appeared at the top of the top list[] and the "peak speed" is given as the "rmax" rating in  lenovo became the world's largest provider for the top supercomputers with  units produced[]
the ibm blue gene/p computer has been used to simulate a number of artificial neurons equivalent to approximately one percent of a human cerebral cortex containing  billion neurons with approximately  trillion connections the same research group also succeeded in using a supercomputer to simulate a number of artificial neurons equivalent to the entirety of a rat's brain[]
modern-day weather forecasting also relies on supercomputers the national oceanic and atmospheric administration uses supercomputers to crunch hundreds of millions of observations to help make weather forecasts more accurate[]

development and trends
distribution of top supercomputers among different countries in november 
in the s china the united states the european union and others competed to be the first to create a  exaflop ( or one quintillion flops) supercomputer[] erik p debenedictis of sandia national laboratories has theorized that a zettaflops ( or one sextillion flops) computer is required to accomplish full weather modeling which could cover a two-week time span accurately[][][] such systems might be built around []
many monte carlo simulations use the same algorithm to process a randomly generated data set; particularly integro-differential equations describing physical transport processes the random paths collisions and energy and momentum depositions of neutrons photons ions electrons etc the next step for microprocessors may be into the third dimension; and specializing to monte carlo the many layers could be identical simplifying the design and manufacture process[]
the cost of operating high performance supercomputers has risen mainly due to increasing power consumption in the mid-s a top  supercomputer required in the range of  kilowatts in  the top  supercomputers required between  and  megawatts[] a  study commissioned by darpa identified power consumption as the most pervasive challenge in achieving exascale computing[] at the time a megawatt per year in energy consumption cost about  million dollars supercomputing facilities were constructed to efficiently remove the increasing amount of heat produced by modern multi-core central processing units based on the energy consumption of the green  list of supercomputers between  and  a supercomputer with  exaflops in  would have required nearly  megawatts operating systems were developed for existing hardware to conserve energy whenever possible[] cpu cores not in use during the execution of a parallelized application were put into low-power states producing energy savings for some supercomputing applications[]
the increasing cost of operating supercomputers has been a driving factor in a trend toward bundling of resources through a distributed supercomputer infrastructure national supercomputing centers first emerged in the us followed by germany and japan the european union launched the partnership for advanced computing in europe (prace) with the aim of creating a persistent pan-european supercomputer infrastructure with services to support scientists across the european union in porting scaling and optimizing supercomputing applications[] iceland built the world's first zero-emission supercomputer located at the thor data center in reykjavík iceland this supercomputer relies on completely renewable sources for its power rather than fossil fuels the colder climate also reduces the need for active cooling making it one of the greenest facilities in the world of computers[]
funding supercomputer hardware also became increasingly difficult in the mid-s a top  supercomputer cost about  million euros while in  the top  supercomputers required an investment of between  and  million euros[] in the s national governments put in place different strategies to fund supercomputers in the uk the national government funded supercomputers entirely and high performance computing was put under the control of a national funding agency germany developed a mixed funding model pooling local state funding and federal funding[]
software is a set of computer programs and associated documentation and data[] this is in contrast to hardware from which the system is built and which actually performs the work
at the lowest programming level executable code consists of machine language instructions supported by an individual processor—typically a central processing unit (cpu) or a graphics processing unit (gpu) machine language consists of groups of binary values signifying processor instructions that change the state of the computer from its preceding state for example an instruction may change the value stored in a particular storage location in the computer—an effect that is not directly observable to the user an instruction may also invoke one of many input or output operations for example displaying some text on a computer screen causing state changes that should be visible to the user the processor executes the instructions in the order they are provided unless it is instructed to "jump" to a different instruction or is interrupted by the operating system as of  most personal computers smartphone devices and servers have processors with multiple execution units or multiple processors performing computation together so computing has become a much more concurrent activity than in the past
the majority of software is written in high-level programming languages they are easier and more efficient for programmers because they are closer to natural languages than machine languages[] high-level languages are translated into machine language using a compiler an interpreter or a combination of the two software may also be written in a low-level assembly language that has a strong correspondence to the computer's machine language instructions and is translated into machine language using an assembler
history
main article: history of software
an algorithm for what would have been the first piece of software was written by ada lovelace in the th century for the planned analytical engine[] she created proofs to show how the engine would calculate bernoulli numbers[] because of the proofs and the algorithm she is considered the first computer programmer[][]
the first theory about software prior to the creation of computers as we know them today was proposed by alan turing in his  essay on computable numbers with an application to the entscheidungsproblem (decision problem)[] this eventually led to the creation of the academic fields of computer science and software engineering; both fields study software and its creation[citation needed] computer science is the theoretical study of computer and software (turing's essay is an example of computer science) whereas software engineering is the application of engineering principles to development of software[]
in  fred shapiro a librarian at the yale law school published a letter revealing that john wilder tukey's  paper "the teaching of concrete mathematics"[][] contained the earliest known usage of the term "software" found in a search of jstor's electronic archives predating the oxford english dictionary's citation by two years[] this led many to credit tukey with coining the term particularly in obituaries published that same year[] although tukey never claimed credit for any such coinage in  paul niquette claimed he had originally coined the term in october  although he could not find any documents supporting his claim[] the earliest known publication of the term "software" in an engineering context was in august  by richard r carhart in a rand corporation research memorandum[]
types
see also: software categories
blender a free software program
on virtually all computer platforms software can be grouped into a few broad categories
purpose or domain of use
based on the goal computer software can be divided into:
application software uses the computer system to perform special functions beyond the basic operation of the computer itself there are many different types of application software because the range of tasks that can be performed with a modern computer is so large—see list of software
system software manages hardware behaviour as to provide basic functionalities that are required by users or for other software to run properly if at all system software is also designed for providing a platform for running application software[] and it includes the following:
operating systems are essential collections of software that manage resources and provide common services for other software that runs "on top" of them supervisory programs boot loaders shells and window systems are core parts of operating systems in practice an operating system comes bundled with additional software (including application software) so that a user can potentially do some work with a computer that only has one operating system
device drivers operate or control a particular type of device that is attached to a computer each device needs at least one corresponding device driver; because a computer typically has at minimum at least one input device and at least one output device a computer typically needs more than one device driver
utilities are computer programs designed to assist users in the maintenance and care of their computers
malicious software or malware is software that is developed to harm or disrupt computers malware is closely associated with computer-related crimes though some malicious programs may have been designed as practical jokes
nature or domain of execution
desktop applications such as web browsers and microsoft office and libreoffice and wordperfect as well as smartphone and tablet applications (called "apps")[citation needed]
javascript scripts are pieces of software traditionally embedded in web pages that are run directly inside the web browser when a web page is loaded without the need for a web browser plugin software written in other programming languages can also be run within the web browser if the software is either translated into javascript or if a web browser plugin that supports that language is installed; the most common example of the latter is actionscript scripts which are supported by the adobe flash plugin[citation needed]
server software including:
web applications which usually run on the web server and output dynamically generated web pages to web browsers using eg php java aspnet or even javascript that runs on the server in modern times these commonly include some javascript to be run in the web browser as well in which case they typically run partly on the server partly in the web browser[citation needed]
plugins and extensions are software that extends or modifies the functionality of another piece of software and require that software be used in order to function[]
embedded software resides as firmware within embedded systems devices dedicated to a single use or a few uses such as cars and televisions (although some embedded devices such as wireless chipsets can themselves be part of an ordinary non-embedded computer system such as a pc or smartphone)[] in the embedded system context there is sometimes no clear distinction between the system software and the application software however some embedded systems run embedded operating systems and these systems do retain the distinction between system software and application software (although typically there will only be one fixed application which is always run)[citation needed]
microcode is a special relatively obscure type of embedded software which tells the processor itself how to execute machine code so it is actually a lower level than machine code[citation needed] it is typically proprietary to the processor manufacturer and any necessary correctional microcode software updates are supplied by them to users (which is much cheaper than shipping replacement processor hardware) thus an ordinary programmer would not expect to ever have to deal with it[citation needed]
programming tools
main article: programming tool
programming tools are also software in the form of programs or applications that developers use to create debug maintain or otherwise support software[][better source needed]
software is written in one or more programming languages; there are many programming languages in existence and each has at least one implementation each of which consists of its own set of programming tools these tools may be relatively self-contained programs such as compilers debuggers interpreters linkers and text editors that can be combined to accomplish a task; or they may form an integrated development environment (ide) which combines much or all of the functionality of such self-contained tools[citation needed] ides may do this by either invoking the relevant individual tools or by re-implementing their functionality in a new way[citation needed] an ide can make it easier to do specific tasks such as searching in files in a particular project[citation needed] many programming language implementations provide the option of using both individual tools or an ide[citation needed]
topics
architecture
see also: software architecture
people who use modern general purpose computers (as opposed to embedded systems analog computers and supercomputers) usually see three layers of software performing a variety of tasks: platform application and user software[citation needed]
platform software: the platform includes the firmware device drivers an operating system and typically a graphical user interface which in total allow a user to interact with the computer and its peripherals (associated equipment) platform software often comes bundled with the computer on a pc one will usually have the ability to change the platform software
application software: application software is what most people think of when they think of software[citation needed] typical examples include office suites and video games application software is often purchased separately from computer hardware sometimes applications are bundled with the computer but that does not change the fact that they run as independent applications applications are usually independent programs from the operating system though they are often tailored for specific platforms most users think of compilers databases and other "system software" as applications[citation needed]
user-written software: end-user development tailors systems to meet users' specific needs user software includes spreadsheet templates and word processor templates[citation needed] even email filters are a kind of user software users create this software themselves and often overlook how important it is[citation needed] depending on how competently the user-written software has been integrated into default application packages many users may not be aware of the distinction between the original packages and what has been added by co-workers[citation needed]
execution
main article: execution (computing)
computer software has to be "loaded" into the computer's storage (such as the hard drive or memory) once the software has loaded the computer is able to execute the software this involves passing instructions from the application software through the system software to the hardware which ultimately receives the instruction as machine code each instruction causes the computer to carry out an operation—moving data carrying out a computation or altering the control flow of instructions[citation needed]
data movement is typically from one place in memory to another sometimes it involves moving data between memory and registers which enable high-speed data access in the cpu moving data especially large amounts of it can be costly; this is sometimes avoided by using "pointers" to data instead[citation needed] computations include simple operations such as incrementing the value of a variable data element more complex computations may involve many operations and data elements together[citation needed]
quality and reliability
main articles: software quality and software testing
software quality is very important especially for commercial and system software if software is faulty it can delete a person's work crash the computer and do other unexpected things faults and errors are called "bugs" which are often discovered during alpha and beta testing[citation needed] software is often also a victim to what is known as software aging the progressive performance degradation resulting from a combination of unseen bugs[citation needed]
many bugs are discovered and fixed through software testing however software testing rarely—if ever—eliminates every bug; some programmers say that "every program has at least one more bug" (lubarsky's law)[] in the waterfall method of software development separate testing teams are typically employed but in newer approaches collectively termed agile software development developers often do all their own testing and demonstrate the software to users/clients regularly to obtain feedback[citation needed] software can be tested through unit testing regression testing and other methods which are done manually or most commonly automatically since the amount of code to be tested can be large[citation needed] programs containing command software enable hardware engineering and system operations to function much easier together[]
license
main article: software license
the software's license gives the user the right to use the software in the licensed environment and in the case of free software licenses also grants other rights such as the right to make copies[]
proprietary software can be divided into two types:
freeware which includes the category of "free trial" software or "freemium" software (in the past the term shareware was often used for free trial/freemium software) as the name suggests freeware can be used for free although in the case of free trials or freemium software this is sometimes only true for a limited period of time or with limited functionality[]
software available for a fee which can only be legally used on purchase of a license[]
open-source software comes with a free software license granting the recipient the rights to modify and redistribute the software[]
patents
main articles: software patent and software patent debate
software patents like other types of patents are theoretically supposed to give an inventor an exclusive time-limited license for a detailed idea (eg an algorithm) on how to implement a piece of software or a component of a piece of software ideas for useful things that software could do and user requirements are not supposed to be patentable and concrete implementations (ie the actual software packages implementing the patent) are not supposed to be patentable either—the latter are already covered by copyright generally automatically so software patents are supposed to cover the middle area between requirements and concrete implementation in some countries a requirement for the claimed invention to have an effect on the physical world may also be part of the requirements for a software patent to be held valid—although since all useful software has effects on the physical world this requirement may be open to debate meanwhile american copyright law was applied to various aspects of the writing of the software code[]
software patents are controversial in the software industry with many people holding different views about them one of the sources of controversy is that the aforementioned split between initial ideas and patent does not seem to be honored in practice by patent lawyers—for example the patent for aspect-oriented programming (aop) which purported to claim rights over any programming tool implementing the idea of aop howsoever implemented[citation needed] another source of controversy is the effect on innovation with many distinguished experts and companies arguing that software is such a fast-moving field that software patents merely create vast additional litigation costs and risks and actually retard innovation[citation needed] in the case of debates about software patents outside the united states the argument has been made that large american corporations and patent lawyers are likely to be the primary beneficiaries of allowing or continue to allow software patents[citation needed]
design and implementation
main articles: software development computer programming and software engineering
design and implementation of software vary depending on the complexity of the software for instance the design and creation of microsoft word took much more time than designing and developing microsoft notepad because the former has much more basic functionality[citation needed]
software is usually developed in integrated development environments (ide) like eclipse intellij and microsoft visual studio that can simplify the process and compile the software[citation needed] as noted in a different section software is usually created on top of existing software and the application programming interface (api) that the underlying software provides like gtk+ javabeans or swing[citation needed] libraries (apis) can be categorized by their purpose for instance the spring framework is used for implementing enterprise applications the windows forms library is used for designing graphical user interface (gui) applications like microsoft word and windows communication foundation is used for designing web services[citation needed] when a program is designed it relies upon the api for instance a microsoft windows desktop application might call api functions in the net windows forms library like formclose() and formshow()[] to close or open the application without these apis the programmer needs to write these functionalities entirely themselves companies like oracle and microsoft provide their own apis so that many applications are written using their software libraries that usually have numerous apis in them[citation needed]
data structures such as hash tables arrays and binary trees and algorithms such as quicksort can be useful for creating software
computer software has special economic characteristics that make its design creation and distribution different from most other economic goods[specify][][]
a person who creates software is called a programmer software engineer or software developer terms that all have a similar meaning more informal terms for programmer also exist such as "coder" and "hacker" – although use of the latter word may cause confusion because it is more often used to mean someone who illegally breaks into computer syst
a neural network can refer to either a neural circuit of biological neurons (sometimes also called a biological neural network) or a network of artificial neurons or nodes in the case of an artificial neural network[] artificial neural networks are used for solving artificial intelligence (ai) problems; they model connections of biological neurons as weights between nodes a positive weight reflects an excitatory connection while negative values mean inhibitory connections all inputs are modified by a weight and summed this activity is referred to as a linear combination finally an activation function controls the amplitude of the output for example an acceptable range of output is usually between  and  or it could be − and 
these artificial networks may be used for predictive modeling adaptive control and applications where they can be trained via a dataset self-learning resulting from experience can occur within networks which can derive conclusions from a complex and seemingly unrelated set of information[]
overview
a biological neural network is composed of a group of chemically connected or functionally associated neurons a single neuron may be connected to many other neurons and the total number of neurons and connections in a network may be extensive connections called synapses are usually formed from axons to dendrites though dendrodendritic synapses[] and other connections are possible apart from electrical signalling there are other forms of signalling that arise from neurotransmitter diffusion
artificial intelligence cognitive modelling and neural networks are information processing paradigms inspired by how biological neural systems process data artificial intelligence and cognitive modelling try to simulate some properties of biological neural networks in the artificial intelligence field artificial neural networks have been applied successfully to speech recognition image analysis and adaptive control in order to construct software agents (in computer and video games) or autonomous robots
historically digital computers evolved from the von neumann model and operate via the execution of explicit instructions via access to memory by a number of processors on the other hand the origins of neural networks are based on efforts to model information processing in biological systems unlike the von neumann model neural network computing does not separate memory and processing
neural network theory has served to identify better how the neurons in the brain function and provide the basis for efforts to create artificial intelligence
history
the preliminary theoretical base for contemporary neural networks was independently proposed by alexander bain[] () and william james[] () in their work both thoughts and body activity resulted from interactions among neurons within the brain
computer simulation of the branching architecture of the dendrites of pyramidal neurons[]
for bain[] every activity led to the firing of a certain set of neurons when activities were repeated the connections between those neurons strengthened according to his theory this repetition was what led to the formation of memory the general scientific community at the time was skeptical of bain's[] theory because it required what appeared to be an inordinate number of neural connections within the brain it is now apparent that the brain is exceedingly complex and that the same brain “wiring” can handle multiple problems and inputs
james'[] theory was similar to bain's[] however he suggested that memories and actions resulted from electrical currents flowing among the neurons in the brain his model by focusing on the flow of electrical currents did not require individual neural connections for each memory or action
c s sherrington[] () conducted experiments to test james' theory he ran electrical currents down the spinal cords of rats however instead of demonstrating an increase in electrical current as projected by james sherrington found that the electrical current strength decreased as the testing continued over time importantly this work led to the discovery of the concept of habituation
wilhelm lenz () and ernst ising () created and analyzed the ising model[] which is essentially a non-learning artificial recurrent neural network (rnn) consisting of neuron-like threshold elements[] in  shun'ichi amari made this architecture adaptive[][] his learning rnn was popularised by john hopfield in [] mcculloch and pitts[] () also created a computational model for neural networks based on mathematics and algorithms they called this model threshold logic these early models paved the way for neural network research to split into two distinct approaches one approach focused on biological processes in the brain and the other focused on the application of neural networks to artificial intelligence
in the late s psychologist donald hebb[] created a hypothesis of learning based on the mechanism of neural plasticity that is now known as hebbian learning hebbian learning is considered to be a 'typical' unsupervised learning rule and its later variants were early models for long term potentiation these ideas started being applied to computational models in  with turing's b-type machines
farley and clark[] () first used computational machines then called calculators to simulate a hebbian network at mit other neural network computational machines were created by rochester holland habit and duda[] ()
frank rosenblatt[] () created the perceptron an algorithm for pattern recognition based on a two-layer learning computer network using simple addition and subtraction with mathematical notation rosenblatt also described circuitry not in the basic perceptron such as the exclusive-or circuit
some say that neural network research stagnated after the publication of machine learning research by marvin minsky and seymour papert[] () they discovered two key issues with the computational machines that processed neural networks the first issue was that single-layer neural networks were incapable of processing the exclusive-or circuit the second significant issue was that computers were not sophisticated enough to effectively handle the long run time required by large neural networks however by the time this book came out methods for training multilayer perceptrons (mlps) were already known the first deep learning mlp was published by alexey grigorevich ivakhnenko and valentin lapa in [][][] the first deep learning mlp trained by stochastic gradient descent[] was published in  by shun'ichi amari[][] in computer experiments conducted by amari's student saito a five layer mlp with two modifiable layers learned useful internal representations to classify non-linearily separable pattern classes[]
neural network research was boosted when computers achieved greater processing power also key in later advances was the backpropagation algorithm it is an efficient application of the leibniz chain rule ()[] to networks of differentiable nodes[] it is also known as the reverse mode of automatic differentiation or reverse accumulation due to seppo linnainmaa ()[][][][][] the term "back-propagating errors" was introduced in  by frank rosenblatt[][] but he did not have an implementation of this procedure although henry j kelley had a continuous precursor of backpropagation[] already in  in the context of control theory[] in  paul werbos applied backpropagation to mlps in the way that has become standard[]
in the late s to early s interest briefly emerged in theoretically investigating the ising model by wilhelm lenz () and ernst ising ()[] in relation to cayley tree topologies and large neural networks in  the ising model was solved exactly by peter barth for the general case of closed cayley trees (with loops) with an arbitrary branching ratio[] and found to exhibit unusual phase transition behavior in its local-apex and long-range site-site correlations[][]
the parallel distributed processing of the mid-s became popular under the name connectionism the text by rumelhart and mcclelland[] () provided a full exposition on the use of connectionism in computers to simulate neural processes
neural networks as used in artificial intelligence have traditionally been viewed as simplified models of neural processing in the brain even though the relation between this model and brain biological architecture is debated as it is not clear to what degree artificial neural networks mirror brain function[]
artificial intelligence
main article: artificial neural network
a neural network (nn) in the case of artificial neurons called artificial neural network (ann) or simulated neural network (snn) is an interconnected group of natural or artificial neurons that uses a mathematical or computational model for information processing based on a connectionistic approach to computation in most cases an ann is an adaptive system that changes its structure based on external or internal information that flows through the network
in more practical terms neural networks are non-linear statistical data modeling or decision making tools they can be used to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs or to find patterns in data
an artificial neural network involves a network of simple processing elements (artificial neurons) which can exhibit complex global behavior determined by the connections between the processing elements and element parameters artificial neurons were first proposed in  by warren mcculloch a neurophysiologist and walter pitts a logician who first collaborated at the university of chicago[]
one classical type of artificial neural network is the recurrent hopfield network
the concept of a neural network appears to have first been proposed by alan turing in his  paper intelligent machinery in which he called them "b-type unorganised machines"[]
the utility of artificial neural network models lies in the fact that they can be used to infer a function from observations and also to use it unsupervised neural networks can also be used to learn representations of the input that capture the salient characteristics of the input distribution eg see the boltzmann machine () and more recently deep learning algorithms which can implicitly learn the distribution function of the observed data learning in neural networks is particularly useful in applications where the complexity of the data or task makes the design of such functions by hand impractical
applications
neural networks can be used in different fields the tasks to which artificial neural networks are applied tend to fall within the following broad categories:
function approximation or regression analysis including time series prediction and modeling
classification including pattern and sequence recognition novelty detection and sequential decision making
data processing including filtering clustering blind signal separation and compression
application areas of anns include nonlinear system identification[] and control (vehicle control process control) game-playing and decision making (backgammon chess racing) pattern recognition (radar systems face identification object recognition) sequence recognition (gesture speech handwritten text recognition) medical diagnosis financial applications data mining (or knowledge discovery in databases "kdd") visualization and e-mail spam filtering for example it is possible to create a semantic profile of user's interests emerging from pictures trained for object recognition[]
neuroscience
theoretical and computational neuroscience is the field concerned with the analysis and computational modeling of biological neural systems since neural systems are intimately related to cognitive processes and behaviour the field is closely related to cognitive and behavioural modeling
the aim of the field is to create models of biological neural systems in order to understand how biological systems work to gain this understanding neuroscientists strive to make a link between observed biological processes (data) biologically plausible mechanisms for neural processing and learning (biological neural network models) and theory (statistical learning theory and information theory)
types of models
many models are used; defined at different levels of abstraction and modeling different aspects of neural systems they range from models of the short-term behaviour of individual neurons through models of the dynamics of neural circuitry arising from interactions between individual neurons to models of behaviour arising from abstract neural modules that represent complete subsystems these include models of the long-term and short-term plasticity of neural systems and their relation to learning and memory from the individual neuron to the system level
connectivity
see also: brain connectivity estimators
in august  scientists reported that bi-directional connections or added appropriate feedback connections can accelerate and improve communication between and in modular neural networks of the brain's cerebral cortex and lower the threshold for their successful communication they showed that adding feedback connections between a resonance pair can support successful propagation of a single pulse packet throughout the entire network[][]
criticism
historically a common criticism of neural networks particularly in robotics was that they require a large diversity of training samples for real-world operation (although if single dimension only  samples required to get practically to low of  error) this is not surprising since any learning machine needs sufficient representative examples in order to capture the underlying structure that allows it to generalize to new cases dean pomerleau in his research presented in the paper "knowledge-based training of artificial neural networks for autonomous robot driving" uses a neural network to train a robotic vehicle to drive on multiple types of roads (single lane multi-lane dirt etc) a large amount of his research is devoted to () extrapolating multiple training scenarios from a single training experience and () preserving past training diversity so that the system does not become overtrained (if for example it is presented with a series of right turns—it should not learn to always turn right) these issues are common in neural networks that must decide from amongst a wide variety of responses but can be dealt with in several ways for example by randomly shuffling the training examples by using a numerical optimization algorithm that does not take too large steps when changing the network connections following an example or by grouping examples in so-called mini-batches
a k dewdney a former scientific american columnist wrote in  "although neural nets do solve a few toy problems their powers of computation are so limited that i am surprised anyone takes them seriously as a general problem-solving tool"[]
arguments for dewdney's position are that to implement large and effective software neural networks much processing and storage resources need to be committed while the brain has hardware tailored to the task of processing signals through a graph of neurons simulating even a most simplified form on von neumann technology may compel a neural network designer to fill many millions of database rows for its connections—which can consume vast amounts of computer memory and data storage capacity furthermore the designer of neural network systems will often need to simulate the transmission of signals through many of these connections and their associated neurons—which must often be matched with incredible amounts of cpu processing power and time while neural networks often yield effective programs they too often do so at the cost of efficiency (they tend to consume considerable amounts of time and money)
arguments against dewdney's position are that neural nets have been successfully used to solve many complex and diverse tasks such as autonomously flying aircraft[]
technology writer roger bridgman commented on dewdney's statements about neural nets:
neural networks for instance are in the dock not only because they have been hyped to high heaven (what hasn't) but also because you could create a successful net without understanding how it worked: the bunch of numbers that captures its behaviour would in all probability be "an opaque unreadable tablevalueless as a scientific resource"
in spite of his emphatic declaration that science is not technology dewdney seems here to pillory neural nets as bad science when most of those devising them are just trying to be good engineers an unreadable table that a useful machine could read would still be well worth having[]
although it is true that analyzing what has been learned by an artificial neural network is difficult it is much easier to do so than to analyze what has been learned by a biological neural network moreover recent emphasis on the explainability of ai has contributed towards the development of methods notably those based on attention mechanisms for visualizing and explaining learned neural networks furthermore researchers involved in exploring learning algorithms for neural networks are gradually uncovering generic principles that allow a learning machine to be successful for example bengio and lecun () wrote an article regarding local vs non-local learning as well as shallow vs deep architecture[]
some other criticisms came from believers of hybrid models (combining neural networks and symbolic approaches) they advocate the intermix of these two approaches and believe that hybrid models can better capture the mechanisms of the human mind (sun and bookman )[full citation needed]
recent improvements
while initially research had been concerned mostly with the electrical characteristics of neurons a particularly important part of the investigation in recent years has been the exploration of the role of neuromodulators such as dopamine acetylcholine and serotonin on behaviour and learning[citation needed]
biophysical models such as bcm theory have been important in understanding mechanisms for synaptic plasticity and have had applications in both computer science and neuroscience research is ongoing in understanding the computational algorithms used in the brain with some recent biological evidence for radial basis networks and neural backpropagation as mechanisms for processing data[citation needed]
computational devices have been created in cmos for both biophysical simulation and neuromorphic computing more recent efforts show promise for creating nanodevices for very large scale principal components analyses and convolution[] if successful these efforts could usher in a new era of neural computing that is a step beyond digital computing[] because it depends on learning rather than programming and because it is fundamentally analog rather than digital even though the first instantiations may in fact be with cmos digital devices
between  and  the recurrent neural networks and deep feedforward neural networks developed in the research group of jürgen schmidhuber at the swiss ai lab idsia have won eight international competitions in pattern recognition and machine learning[] for example multi-dimensional long short term memory (lstm)[][] won three competitions in connected handwriting recognition at the  international conference on document analysis and recognition (icdar) without any prior knowledge about the three different languages to be learned
variants of the back-propagation algorithm as well as unsupervised methods by geoff hinton and colleagues at the university of toronto can be used to train deep highly nonlinear neural architectures[] similar to the  neocognitron by kunihiko fukushima[] and the "standard architecture of vision"[] inspired by the simple and complex cells identified by david h hubel and torsten wiesel in the primary visual cortex
radial basis function and wavelet networks have also been introduced these can be shown to offer best approximation properties and have been applied in nonlinear system identification and classification applications[]
deep learning feedforward networks alternate convolutional layers and max-pooling layers topped by several pure classification layers fast gpu-based implementations of this approach have won several pattern recognition contests including the ijcnn  traffic sign recognition competition[] and the isbi  segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopy stacks challenge[] such neural networks also were the first artificial pattern recognizers to achieve human-competitive or even superhuman performance[] on benchmarks such as traffic sign recognition (ijcnn ) or the mnist handwritten digits problem of yann lecun and colleagues at nyu
analytical and computational techniques derived from statistical physics of disordered systems can be extended to large-scale problems including machine learning eg to analyze the weight space of deep neural networks[]
pattern recognition is the automated recognition of patterns and regularities in data while similar pattern recognition (pr) is not to be confused with pattern machines (pm) which may possess (pr) capabilities but their primary function is to distinguish and create emergent pattern pr has applications in statistical data analysis signal processing image analysis information retrieval bioinformatics data compression computer graphics and machine learning pattern recognition has its origins in statistics and engineering; some modern approaches to pattern recognition include the use of machine learning due to the increased availability of big data and a new abundance of processing power
pattern recognition systems are commonly trained from labeled "training" data when no labeled data are available other algorithms can be used to discover previously unknown patterns kdd and data mining have a larger focus on unsupervised methods and stronger connection to business use pattern recognition focuses more on the signal and also takes acquisition and signal processing into consideration it originated in engineering and the term is popular in the context of computer vision: a leading computer vision conference is named conference on computer vision and pattern recognition
in machine learning pattern recognition is the assignment of a label to a given input value in statistics discriminant analysis was introduced for this same purpose in  an example of pattern recognition is classification which attempts to assign each input value to one of a given set of classes (for example determine whether a given email is "spam") pattern recognition is a more general problem that encompasses other types of output as well other examples are regression which assigns a real-valued output to each input;[] sequence labeling which assigns a class to each member of a sequence of values[] (for example part of speech tagging which assigns a part of speech to each word in an input sentence); and parsing which assigns a parse tree to an input sentence describing the syntactic structure of the sentence[]
pattern recognition algorithms generally aim to provide a reasonable answer for all possible inputs and to perform "most likely" matching of the inputs taking into account their statistical variation this is opposed to pattern matching algorithms which look for exact matches in the input with pre-existing patterns a common example of a pattern-matching algorithm is regular expression matching which looks for patterns of a given sort in textual data and is included in the search capabilities of many text editors and word processors

a modern definition of pattern recognition is:
the field of pattern recognition is concerned with the automatic discovery of regularities in data through the use of computer algorithms and with the use of these regularities to take actions such as classifying the data into different categories[]
pattern recognition is generally categorized according to the type of learning procedure used to generate the output value supervised learning assumes that a set of training data (the training set) has been provided consisting of a set of instances that have been properly labeled by hand with the correct output a learning procedure then generates a model that attempts to meet two sometimes conflicting objectives: perform as well as possible on the training data and generalize as well as possible to new data (usually this means being as simple as possible for some technical definition of "simple" in accordance with occam's razor discussed below) unsupervised learning on the other hand assumes training data that has not been hand-labeled and attempts to find inherent patterns in the data that can then be used to determine the correct output value for new data instances[] a combination of the two that has been explored is semi-supervised learning which uses a combination of labeled and unlabeled data (typically a small set of labeled data combined with a large amount of unlabeled data) in cases of unsupervised learning there may be no training data at all
sometimes different terms are used to describe the corresponding supervised and unsupervised learning procedures for the same type of output the unsupervised equivalent of classification is normally known as clustering based on the common perception of the task as involving no training data to speak of and of grouping the input data into clusters based on some inherent similarity measure (eg the distance between instances considered as vectors in a multi-dimensional vector space) rather than assigning each input instance into one of a set of pre-defined classes in some fields the terminology is different in community ecology the term classification is used to refer to what is commonly known as "clustering"
the piece of input data for which an output value is generated is formally termed an instance the instance is formally described by a vector of features which together constitute a description of all known characteristics of the instance these feature vectors can be seen as defining points in an appropriate multidimensional space and methods for manipulating vectors in vector spaces can be correspondingly applied to them such as computing the dot product or the angle between two vectors features typically are either categorical (also known as nominal ie consisting of one of a set of unordered items such as a gender of "male" or "female" or a blood type of "a" "b" "ab" or "o") ordinal (consisting of one of a set of ordered items eg "large" "medium" or "small") integer-valued (eg a count of the number of occurrences of a particular word in an email) or real-valued (eg a measurement of blood pressure) often categorical and ordinal data are grouped together and this is also the case for integer-valued and real-valued data many algorithms work only in terms of categorical data and require that real-valued or integer-valued data be discretized into groups (eg less than  between  and  or greater than )
probabilistic classifiers
main article: probabilistic classifier
many common pattern recognition algorithms are probabilistic in nature in that they use statistical inference to find the best label for a given instance unlike other algorithms which simply output a "best" label often probabilistic algorithms also output a probability of the instance being described by the given label in addition many probabilistic algorithms output a list of the n-best labels with associated probabilities for some value of n instead of simply a single best label when the number of possible labels is fairly small (eg in the case of classification) n may be set so that the probability of all possible labels is output probabilistic algorithms have many advantages over non-probabilistic algorithms:
they output a confidence value associated with their choice (note that some other algorithms may also output confidence values but in general only for probabilistic algorithms is this value mathematically grounded in probability theory non-probabilistic confidence values can in general not be given any specific meaning and only used to compare against other confidence values output by the same algorithm)
correspondingly they can abstain when the confidence of choosing any particular output is too low
because of the probabilities output probabilistic pattern-recognition algorithms can be more effectively incorporated into larger machine-learning tasks in a way that partially or completely avoids the problem of error propagation
probabilistic pattern classifiers can be used according to a frequentist or a bayesian approach
the face was automatically detected by special software
within medical science pattern recognition is the basis for computer-aided diagnosis (cad) systems cad describes a procedure that supports the doctor's interpretations and findings other typical applications of pattern recognition techniques are automatic speech recognition speaker identification classification of text into several categories (eg spam or non-spam email messages) the automatic recognition of handwriting on postal envelopes automatic recognition of images of human faces or handwriting image extraction from medical forms[][] the last two examples form the subtopic image analysis of pattern recognition that deals with digital images as input to pattern recognition systems[][]
optical character recognition is an example of the application of a pattern classifier the method of signing one's name was captured with stylus and overlay starting in [citation needed] the strokes speed relative min relative max acceleration and pressure is used to uniquely identify and confirm identity banks were first offered this technology but were content to collect from the fdic for any bank fraud and did not want to inconvenience customers[citation needed]
pattern recognition has many real-world applications in image processing some examples include:
identification and authentication: eg license plate recognition[] fingerprint analysis face detection/verification;[] and voice-based authentication[]
medical diagnosis: eg screening for cervical cancer (papnet)[] breast tumors or heart sounds;
defense: various navigation and guidance systems target recognition systems shape recognition technology etc
mobility: advanced driver assistance systems autonomous vehicle technology etc[][][][][]
in psychology pattern recognition is used to make sense of and identify objects and is closely related to perception this explains how the sensory inputs humans receive are made meaningful pattern recognition can be thought of in two different ways the first concerns template matching and the second concerns feature detection a template is a pattern used to produce items of the same proportions the template-matching hypothesis suggests that incoming stimuli are compared with templates in the long-term memory if there is a match the stimulus is identified feature detection models such as the pandemonium system for classifying letters (selfridge ) suggest that the stimuli are broken down into their component parts for identification one observation is a capital e having three horizontal lines and one vertical line[]
algorithms
algorithms for pattern recognition depend on the type of label output on whether learning is supervised or unsupervised and on whether the algorithm is statistical or non-statistical in nature statistical algorithms can further be categorized as generative or discriminative
deep learning is part of a broader family of machine learning methods which is based on artificial neural networks with representation learning the adjective "deep" in deep learning refers to the use of multiple layers in the network methods used can be either supervised semi-supervised or unsupervised[]
deep-learning architectures such as deep neural networks deep belief networks deep reinforcement learning recurrent neural networks convolutional neural networks and transformers have been applied to fields including computer vision speech recognition natural language processing machine translation bioinformatics drug design medical image analysis climate science material inspection and board game programs where they have produced results comparable to and in some cases surpassing human expert performance[][][]
artificial neural networks (anns) were inspired by information processing and distributed communication nodes in biological systems anns have various differences from biological brains specifically artificial neural networks tend to be static and symbolic while the biological brain of most living organisms is dynamic (plastic) and analog[][]
definition
deep learning is a class of machine learning algorithms that[]: –  uses multiple layers to progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input for example in image processing lower layers may identify edges while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits or letters or faces
from another angle to view deep learning deep learning refers to "computer-simulate" or "automate" human learning processes from a source (eg an image of dogs) to a learned object (dogs) therefore a notion coined as "deeper" learning or "deepest" learning[] makes sense the deepest learning refers to the fully automatic learning from a source to a final learned object a deeper learning thus refers to a mixed learning process: a human learning process from a source to a learned semi-object followed by a computer learning process from the human learned semi-object to a final learned object
overview
most modern deep learning models are based on multi-layered artificial neural networks such as convolutional neural networks and transformers although they can also include propositional formulas or latent variables organized layer-wise in deep generative models such as the nodes in deep belief networks and deep boltzmann machines[]
in deep learning each level learns to transform its input data into a slightly more abstract and composite representation in an image recognition application the raw input may be a matrix of pixels; the first representational layer may abstract the pixels and encode edges; the second layer may compose and encode arrangements of edges; the third layer may encode a nose and eyes; and the fourth layer may recognize that the image contains a face importantly a deep learning process can learn which features to optimally place in which level on its own this does not eliminate the need for hand-tuning; for example varying numbers of layers and layer sizes can provide different degrees of abstraction[][]
the word "deep" in "deep learning" refers to the number of layers through which the data is transformed more precisely deep learning systems have a substantial credit assignment path (cap) depth the cap is the chain of transformations from input to output caps describe potentially causal connections between input and output for a feedforward neural network the depth of the caps is that of the network and is the number of hidden layers plus one (as the output layer is also parameterized) for recurrent neural networks in which a signal may propagate through a layer more than once the cap depth is potentially unlimited[] no universally agreed-upon threshold of depth divides shallow learning from deep learning but most researchers agree that deep learning involves cap depth higher than  cap of depth  has been shown to be a universal approximator in the sense that it can emulate any function[] beyond that more layers do not add to the function approximator ability of the network deep models (cap > ) are able to extract better features than shallow models and hence extra layers help in learning the features effectively
deep learning architectures can be constructed with a greedy layer-by-layer method[] deep learning helps to disentangle these abstractions and pick out which features improve performance[]
for supervised learning tasks deep learning methods eliminate feature engineering by translating the data into compact intermediate representations akin to principal components and derive layered structures that remove redundancy in representation
deep learning algorithms can be applied to unsupervised learning tasks this is an important benefit because unlabeled data are more abundant than the labeled data examples of deep structures that can be trained in an unsupervised manner are deep belief networks[][]
interpretations
deep neural networks are generally interpreted in terms of the universal approximation theorem[][][][][] or probabilistic inference[][][][][]
the classic universal approximation theorem concerns the capacity of feedforward neural networks with a single hidden layer of finite size to approximate continuous functions[][][][] in  the first proof was published by george cybenko for sigmoid activation functions[] and was generalised to feed-forward multi-layer architectures in  by kurt hornik[] recent work also showed that universal approximation also holds for non-bounded activation functions such as kunihiko fukushima's rectified linear unit[][]
the universal approximation theorem for deep neural networks concerns the capacity of networks with bounded width but the depth is allowed to grow lu et al[] proved that if the width of a deep neural network with relu activation is strictly larger than the input dimension then the network can approximate any lebesgue integrable function; if the width is smaller or equal to the input dimension then a deep neural network is not a universal approximator
the probabilistic interpretation[] derives from the field of machine learning it features inference[][][][][][] as well as the optimization concepts of training and testing related to fitting and generalization respectively more specifically the probabilistic interpretation considers the activation nonlinearity as a cumulative distribution function[] the probabilistic interpretation led to the introduction of dropout as regularizer in neural networks the probabilistic interpretation was introduced by researchers including hopfield widrow and narendra and popularized in surveys such as the one by bishop[]
history
there are two types of neural networks: feedforward neural networks (fnns) and recurrent neural networks (rnns) rnns have cycles in their connectivity structure fnns don't in the s wilhelm lenz and ernst ising created and analyzed the ising model[] which is essentially a non-learning rnn architecture consisting of neuron-like threshold elements in  shun'ichi amari made this architecture adaptive[][] his learning rnn was popularised by john hopfield in [] rnns have become central for speech recognition and language processing
charles tappert writes that frank rosenblatt developed and explored all of the basic ingredients of the deep learning systems of today[] referring to rosenblatt's  book[] which introduced a multilayer perceptron (mlp) with  layers: an input layer a hidden layer with randomized weights that did not learn and an output layer[] however since only the output layer had learning connections this was not yet deep learning it was what later was called an extreme learning machine[]
the first general working learning algorithm for supervised deep feedforward multilayer perceptrons was published by alexey ivakhnenko and lapa in [] a  paper described a deep network with eight layers trained by the group method of data handling[]
the first deep learning multilayer perceptron trained by stochastic gradient descent[] was published in  by shun'ichi amari[][] in computer experiments conducted by amari's student saito a five layer mlp with two modifiable layers learned internal representations to classify non-linearily separable pattern classes[] in  matthew brand reported that wide -layer nonlinear perceptrons could be fully end-to-end trained to reproduce logic functions of nontrivial circuit depth via gradient descent on small batches of random input/output samples but concluded that training time on contemporary hardware (sub-megaflop computers) made the technique impractical and proposed using fixed random early layers as an input hash for a single modifiable layer[] instead subsequent developments in hardware and hyperparameter tunings have made end-to-end stochastic gradient descent the currently dominant training technique
in  seppo linnainmaa published the reverse mode of automatic differentiation of discrete connected networks of nested differentiable functions[][][] this became known as backpropagation[] it is an efficient application of the chain rule derived by gottfried wilhelm leibniz in [] to networks of differentiable nodes[] the terminology "back-propagating errors" was actually introduced in  by rosenblatt[][] but he did not know how to implement this although henry j kelley had a continuous precursor of backpropagation[] already in  in the context of control theory[] in  paul werbos applied backpropagation to mlps in the way that has become standard[][][] in  david e rumelhart et al published an experimental analysis of the technique[]
deep learning architectures for convolutional neural networks (cnns) with convolutional layers and downsampling layers began with the neocognitron introduced by kunihiko fukushima in [] in  he also introduced the relu (rectified linear unit) activation function[][] the rectifier has become the most popular activation function for cnns and deep learning in general[] cnns have become an essential tool for computer vision
the term deep learning was introduced to the machine learning community by rina dechter in [] and to artificial neural networks by igor aizenberg and colleagues in  in the context of boolean threshold neurons[][]
in  wei zhang et al applied the backpropagation algorithm to a convolutional neural network (a simplified neocognitron with convolutional interconnections between the image feature layers and the last fully connected layer) for alphabet recognition they also proposed an implementation of the cnn with an optical computing system[][] in  yann lecun et al applied backpropagation to a cnn with the purpose of recognizing handwritten zip codes on mail while the algorithm worked training required  days[] subsequently wei zhang et al modified their model by removing the last fully connected layer and applied it for medical image object segmentation in [] and breast cancer detection in mammograms in [] lenet- () a -level cnn by yann lecun et al[] that classifies digits was applied by several banks to recognize hand-written numbers on checks digitized in x pixel images
in the s backpropagation did not work well for deep learning with long credit assignment paths to overcome this problem jürgen schmidhuber () proposed a hierarchy of rnns pre-trained one level at a time by self-supervised learning[] it uses predictive coding to learn internal representations at multiple self-organizing time scales this can substantially facilitate downstream deep learning the rnn hierarchy can be collapsed into a single rnn by distilling a higher level chunker network into a lower level automatizer network[][] in  a chunker solved a deep learning task whose depth exceeded []
in  jürgen schmidhuber also published an alternative to rnns[] which is now called a linear transformer or a transformer with linearized self-attention[][][] (save for a normalization operator) it learns internal spotlights of attention:[] a slow feedforward neural network learns by gradient descent to control the fast weights of another neural network through outer products of self-generated activation patterns from and to (which are now called key and value for self-attention)[] this fast weight attention mapping is applied to a query pattern
the modern transformer was introduced by ashish vaswani et al in their  paper "attention is all you need"[] it combines this with a softmax operator and a projection matrix[] transformers have increasingly become the model of choice for natural language processing[] many modern large language models such as chatgpt gpt- and bert use it transformers are also increasingly being used in computer vision[]
in  jürgen schmidhuber also published adversarial neural networks that contest with each other in the form of a zero-sum game where one network's gain is the other network's loss[][][] the first network is a generative model that models a probability distribution over output patterns the second network learns by gradient descent to predict the reactions of the environment to these patterns this was called "artificial curiosity" in  this principle was used in a generative adversarial network (gan) by ian goodfellow et al[] here the environmental reaction is  or  depending on whether the first network's output is in a given set this can be used to create realistic deepfakes[] excellent image quality is achieved by nvidia's stylegan ()[] based on the progressive gan by tero karras et al[] here the gan generator is grown from small to large scale in a pyramidal fashion
sepp hochreiter's diploma thesis ()[] was called "one of the most important documents in the history of machine learning" by his supervisor schmidhuber[] it not only tested the neural history compressor[] but also identified and analyzed the vanishing gradient problem[][] hochreiter proposed recurrent residual connections to solve this problem this led to the deep learning method called long short-term memory (lstm) published in [] lstm recurrent neural networks can learn "very deep learning" tasks[] with long credit assignment paths that require memories of events that happened thousands of discrete time steps before the "vanilla lstm" with forget gate was introduced in  by felix gers schmidhuber and fred cummins[] lstm has become the most cited neural network of the th century[] in  rupesh kumar srivastava klaus greff and schmidhuber used lstm principles to create the highway network a feedforward neural network with hundreds of layers much deeper than previous networks[][]  months later kaiming he xiangyu zhang; shaoqing ren and jian sun won the imagenet  competition with an open-gated or gateless highway network variant called residual neural network[] this has become the most cited neural network of the st century[]
in  andré de carvalho together with mike fairhurst and david bisset published experimental results of a multi-layer boolean neural network also known as a weightless neural network composed of a -layers self-organising feature extraction neural network module (soft) followed by a multi-layer classification neural network module (gsn) which were independently trained each layer in the feature extraction module extracted features with growing complexity regarding the previous layer[]
in  brendan frey demonstrated that it was possible to train (over two days) a network containing six fully connected layers and several hundred hidden units using the wake-sleep algorithm co-developed with peter dayan and hinton[]
since  sven behnke extended the feed-forward hierarchical convolutional approach in the neural abstraction pyramid[] by lateral and backward connections in order to flexibly incorporate context into decisions and iteratively resolve local ambiguities
simpler models that use task-specific handcrafted features such as gabor filters and support vector machines (svms) were a popular choice in the s and s because of artificial neural network's (ann) computational cost and a lack of understanding of how the brain wires its biological networks
both shallow and deep learning (eg recurrent nets) of anns for speech recognition have been explored for many years[][][] these methods never outperformed non-uniform internal-handcrafting gaussian mixture model/hidden markov model (gmm-hmm) technology based on generative models of speech trained discriminatively[] key difficulties have been analyzed including gradient diminishing[] and weak temporal correlation structure in neural predictive models[][] additional difficulties were the lack of training data and limited computing power most speech recognition researchers moved away from neural nets to pursue generative modeling an exception was at sri international in the late s funded by the us government's nsa and darpa sri studied deep neural networks in speech and speaker recognition the speaker recognition team led by larry heck reported significant success with deep neural networks in speech processing in the  national institute of standards and technology speaker recognition evaluation[] the sri deep neural network was then deployed in the nuance verifier representing the first major industrial application of deep learning[] the principle of elevating "raw" features over hand-crafted optimization was first explored successfully in the architecture of deep autoencoder on the "raw" spectrogram or linear filter-bank features in the late s[] showing its superiority over the mel-cepstral features that contain stages of fixed transformation from spectrograms the raw features of speech waveforms later produced excellent larger-scale results[]
speech recognition was taken over by lstm in  lstm started to become competitive with traditional speech recognizers on certain tasks[] in  alex graves santiago fernández faustino gomez and schmidhuber combined it with connectionist temporal classification (ctc)[] in stacks of lstm rnns[] in  google's speech recognition reportedly experienced a dramatic performance jump of  through ctc-trained lstm which they made available through google voice search[]
the impact of deep learning in industry began in the early s when cnns already processed an estimated  to  of all the checks written in the us according to yann lecun[] industrial applications of deep learning to large-scale speech recognition started around 
in  publications by geoff hinton ruslan salakhutdinov osindero and teh[][][] showed how a many-layered feedforward neural network could be effectively pre-trained one layer at a time treating each layer in turn as an unsupervised restricted boltzmann machine then fine-tuning it using supervised backpropagation[] the papers referred to learning for deep belief nets
the  nips workshop on deep learning for speech recognition was motivated by the limitations of deep generative models of speech and the possibility that given more capable hardware and large-scale data sets that deep neural nets (dnn) might become practical it was believed that pre-training dnns using generative models of deep belief nets (dbn) would overcome the main difficulties of neural nets however it was discovered that replacing pre-training with large amounts of training data for straightforward backpropagation when using dnns with large context-dependent output layers produced error rates dramatically lower than then-state-of-the-art gaussian mixture model (gmm)/hidden markov model (hmm) and also than more-advanced generative model-based systems[] the nature of the recognition errors produced by the two types of systems was characteristically different[] offering technical insights into how to integrate deep learning into the existing highly efficient run-time speech decoding system deployed by all major speech recognition systems[][][] analysis around – contrasting the gmm (and other generative speech models) vs dnn models stimulated early industrial investment in deep learning for speech recognition[] that analysis was done with comparable performance (less than  in error rate) between discriminative dnns and generative models[][][] in  researchers extended deep learning from timit to large vocabulary speech recognition by adopting large output layers of the dnn based on context-dependent hmm states constructed by decision trees[][][][]
deep learning is part of state-of-the-art systems in various disciplines particularly computer vision and automatic speech recognition (asr) results on commonly used evaluation sets such as timit (asr) and mnist (image classification) as well as a range of large-vocabulary speech recognition tasks have steadily improved[][] convolutional neural networks (cnns) were superseded for asr by ctc[] for lstm[][][][][] but are more successful in computer vision
advances in hardware have driven renewed interest in deep learning in  nvidia was involved in what was called the "big bang" of deep learning "as deep-learning neural networks were trained with nvidia graphics processing units (gpus)"[] that year andrew ng determined that gpus could increase the speed of deep-learning systems by about  times[] in particular gpus are well-suited for the matrix/vector computations involved in machine learning[][][] gpus speed up training algorithms by orders of magnitude reducing running times from weeks to days[][] further specialized hardware and algorithm optimizations can be used for efficient processing of deep learning models[]
deep learning revolution
how deep learning is a subset of machine learning and how machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (ai)
in the late s deep learning started to outperform other methods in machine learning competitions in  a long short-term memory trained by connectionist temporal classification (alex graves santiago fernández faustino gomez and jürgen schmidhuber )[] was the first rnn to win pattern recognition contests winning three competitions in connected handwriting recognition[][] google later used ctc-trained lstm for speech recognition on the smartphone[][]
significant impacts in image or object recognition were felt from  to  although cnns trained by backpropagation had been around for decades[][] and gpu implementations of nns for years[] including cnns[][] faster implementations of cnns on gpus were needed to progress on computer vision in  the dannet[][] by dan ciresan ueli meier jonathan masci luca maria gambardella and jürgen schmidhuber achieved for the first time superhuman performance in a visual pattern recognition contest outperforming traditional methods by a factor of [] also in  dannet won the icdar chinese handwriting contest and in may  it won the isbi image segmentation contest[] until  cnns did not play a major role at computer vision conferences but in june  a paper by ciresan et al at the leading conference cvpr[] showed how max-pooling cnns on gpu can dramatically improve many vision benchmark records in september  dannet also won the icpr contest on analysis of large medical images for cancer detection and in the following year also the miccai grand challenge on the same topic[] in october  the similar alexnet by alex krizhevsky ilya sutskever and geoffrey hinton[] won the large-scale imagenet competition by a significant margin over shallow machine learning methods the vgg- network by karen simonyan and andrew zisserman[] further reduced the error rate and won the imagenet  competition following a similar trend in large-scale speech recognition
image classification was then extended to the more challenging task of generating descriptions (captions) for images often as a combination of cnns and lstms[][][]
in  a team led by george e dahl won the "merck molecular activity challenge" using multi-task deep neural networks to predict the biomolecular target of one drug[][] in  sepp hochreiter's group used deep learning to detect off-target and toxic effects of environmental chemicals in nutrients household products and drugs and won the "tox data challenge" of nih fda and ncats[][][]
in  roger parloff mentioned a "deep learning revolution" that has transformed the ai industry[]
in march  yoshua bengio geoffrey hinton and yann lecun were awarded the turing award for conceptual and engineering breakthroughs that have made deep neural networks a critical component of computing
neural networks
main article: artificial neural network
artificial neural networks (anns) or connectionist systems are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains such systems learn (progressively improve their ability) to do tasks by considering examples generally without task-specific programming for example in image recognition they might learn to identify images that contain cats by analyzing example images that have been manually labeled as "cat" or "no cat" and using the analytic results to identify cats in other images they have found most use in applications difficult to express with a traditional computer algorithm using rule-based programming
an ann is based on a collection of connected units called artificial neurons (analogous to biological neurons in a biological brain) each connection (synapse) between neurons can transmit a signal to another neuron the receiving (postsynaptic) neuron can process the signal(s) and then signal downstream neurons connected to it neurons may have state generally represented by real numbers typically between  and  neurons and synapses may also have a weight that varies as learning proceeds which can increase or decrease the strength of the signal that it sends downstream
typically neurons are organized in layers different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs signals travel from the first (input) to the last (output) layer possibly after traversing the layers multiple times
the original goal of the neural network approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would over time attention focused on matching specific mental abilities leading to deviations from biology such as backpropagation or passing information in the reverse direction and adjusting the network to reflect that information
neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks including computer vision speech recognition machine translation social network filtering playing board and video games and medical diagnosis
as of  neural networks typically have a few thousand to a few million units and millions of connections despite this number being several order of magnitude less than the number of neurons on a human brain these networks can perform many tasks at a level beyond that of humans (eg recognizing faces or playing "go"[])
deep neural networks
a deep neural network (dnn) is an artificial neural network (ann) with multiple layers between the input and output layers[][] there are different types of neural networks but they always consist of the same components: neurons synapses weights biases and functions[] these components as a whole function similarly to a human brain and can be trained like any other ml algorithm[citation needed]
for example a dnn that is trained to recognize dog breeds will go over the given image and calculate the probability that the dog in the image is a certain breed the user can review the results and select which probabilities the network should display (above a certain threshold etc) and return the proposed label each mathematical manipulation as such is considered a layer[citation needed] and complex dnn have many layers hence the name "deep" networks
dnns can model complex non-linear relationships dnn architectures generate compositional models where the object is expressed as a layered composition of primitives[] the extra layers enable composition of features from lower layers potentially modeling complex data with fewer units than a similarly performing shallow network[] for instance it was proved that sparse multivariate polynomials are exponentially easier to approximate with dnns than with shallow networks[]
deep architectures include many variants of a few basic approaches each architecture has found success in specific domains it is not always possible to compare the performance of multiple architectures unless they have been evaluated on the same data sets
dnns are typically feedforward networks in which data flows from the input layer to the output layer without looping back at first the dnn creates a map of virtual neurons and assigns random numerical values or "weights" to connections between them the weights and inputs are multiplied and return an output between  and  if the network did not accurately recognize a particular pattern an algorithm would adjust the weights[] that way the algorithm can make certain parameters more influential until it determines the correct mathematical manipulation to fully process the data
recurrent neural networks (rnns) in which data can flow in any direction are used for applications such as language modeling[][][][][] long short-term memory is particularly effective for this use[][]
convolutional deep neural networks (cnns) are used in computer vision[] cnns also have been applied to acoustic modeling for automatic speech recognition (asr)[]
challenges
as with anns many issues can arise with naively trained dnns two common issues are overfitting and computation time
dnns are prone to overfitting because of the added layers of abstraction which allow them to model rare dependencies in the training data regularization methods such as ivakhnenko's unit pruning[] or weight decay (
can be applied during training to combat overfitting[] alternatively dropout regularization randomly omits units from the hidden layers during training this helps to exclude rare dependencies[] finally data can be augmented via methods such as cropping and rotating such that smaller training sets can be increased in size to reduce the chances of overfitting[]
dnns must consider many training parameters such as the size (number of layers and number of units per layer) the learning rate and initial weights sweeping through the parameter space for optimal parameters may not be feasible due to the cost in time and computational resources various tricks such as batching (computing the gradient on several training examples at once rather than individual examples)[] speed up computation large processing capabilities of many-core architectures (such as gpus or the intel xeon phi) have produced significant speedups in training because of the suitability of such processing architectures for the matrix and vector computations[][]
alternatively engineers may look for other types of neural networks with more straightforward and convergent training algorithms cmac (cerebellar model articulation controller) is one such kind of neural network it doesn't require learning rates or randomized initial weights the training process can be guaranteed to converge in one step with a new batch of data and the computational complexity of the training algorithm is linear with respect to the number of neurons involved[][]
hardware
since the s advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks that contain many layers of non-linear hidden units and a very large output layer[] by  graphic processing units (gpus) often with ai-specific enhancements had displaced cpus as the dominant method of training large-scale commercial cloud ai[] openai estimated the hardware computation used in the largest deep learning projects from alexnet () to alphazero () and found a -fold increase in the amount of computation required with a doubling-time trendline of  months[][]
special electronic circuits called deep learning processors were designed to speed up deep learning algorithms deep learning processors include neural processing units (npus) in huawei cellphones[] and cloud computing servers such as tensor processing units (tpu) in the google cloud platform[] cerebras systems has also built a dedicated system to handle large deep learning models the cs- based on the largest processor in the industry the second-generation wafer scale engine (wse-)[][]
atomically thin semiconductors are considered promising for energy-efficient deep learning hardware where the same basic device structure is used for both logic operations and data storage in  marega et al published experiments with a large-area active channel material for developing logic-in-memory devices and circuits based on floating-gate field-effect transistors (fgfets)[]
in  j feldmann et al proposed an integrated photonic hardware accelerator for parallel convolutional processing[] the authors identify two key advantages of integrated photonics over its electronic counterparts: () massively parallel data transfer through wavelength division multiplexing in conjunction with frequency combs and () extremely high data modulation speeds[] their system can execute trillions of multiply-accumulate operations per second indicating the potential of integrated photonics in data-heavy ai applications[]

natural language processing
main article: natural language processing
neural networks have been used for implementing language models since the early s[] lstm helped to improve machine translation and language modeling[][][]
other key techniques in this field are negative sampling[] and word embedding word embedding such as wordvec can be thought of as a representational layer in a deep learning architecture that transforms an atomic word into a positional representation of the word relative to other words in the dataset; the position is represented as a point in a vector space using word embedding as an rnn input layer allows the network to parse sentences and phrases using an effective compositional vector grammar a compositional vector grammar can be thought of as probabilistic context free grammar (pcfg) implemented by an rnn[] recursive auto-encoders built atop word embeddings can assess sentence similarity and detect paraphrasing[] deep neural architectures provide the best results for constituency parsing[] sentiment analysis[] information retrieval[][] spoken language understanding[] machine translation[][] contextual entity linking[] writing style recognition[] named-entity recognition (token classification)[] text classification and others[]
recent developments generalize word embedding to sentence embedding

drug discovery and toxicology
for more information see drug discovery and toxicology
a large percentage of candidate drugs fail to win regulatory approval these failures are caused by insufficient efficacy (on-target effect) undesired interactions (off-target effects) or unanticipated toxic effects[][] research has explored use of deep learning to predict the biomolecular targets[][] off-targets and toxic effects of environmental chemicals in nutrients household products and drugs[][][]

relation to human cognitive and brain development
deep learning is closely related to a class of theories of brain development (specifically neocortical development) proposed by cognitive neuroscientists in the early s[][][][] these developmental theories were instantiated in computational models making them predecessors of deep learning systems these developmental models share the property that various proposed learning dynamics in the brain (eg a wave of nerve growth factor) support the self-organization somewhat analogous to the neural networks utilized in deep learning models like the neocortex neural networks employ a hierarchy of layered filters in which each layer considers information from a prior layer (or the operating environment) and then passes its output (and possibly the original input) to other layers this process yields a self-organizing stack of transducers well-tuned to their operating environment a  description stated "the infant's brain seems to organize itself under the influence of waves of so-called trophic-factors  different regions of the brain become connected sequentially with one layer of tissue maturing before another and so on until the whole brain is mature"[]
a variety of approaches have been used to investigate the plausibility of deep learning models from a neurobiological perspective on the one hand several variants of the backpropagation algorithm have been proposed in order to increase its processing realism[][] other researchers have argued that unsupervised forms of deep learning such as those based on hierarchical generative models and deep belief networks may be closer to biological reality[][] in this respect generative neural network models have been related to neurobiological evidence about sampling-based processing in the cerebral cortex[]
although a systematic comparison between the human brain organization and the neuronal encoding in deep networks has not yet been established several analogies have been reported for example the computations performed by deep learning units could be similar to those of actual neurons[] and neural populations[] similarly the representations developed by deep learning models are similar to those measured in the primate visual system[] both at the single-unit[] and at the population[] levels

criticism and comment
deep learning has attracted both criticism and comment in some cases from outside the field of computer science
theory
see also: explainable artificial intelligence
a main criticism concerns the lack of theory surrounding some methods[] learning in the most common deep architectures is implemented using well-understood gradient descent however the theory surrounding other algorithms such as contrastive divergence is less clear[citation needed] (eg does it converge if so how fast what is it approximating) deep learning methods are often looked at as a black box with most confirmations done empirically rather than theoretically[]
others point out that deep learning should be looked at as a step towards realizing strong ai not as an all-encompassing solution despite the power of deep learning methods they still lack much of the functionality needed for realizing this goal entirely research psychologist gary marcus noted:
realistically deep learning is only part of the larger challenge of building intelligent machines such techniques lack ways of representing causal relationships () have no obvious ways of performing logical inferences and they are also still a long way from integrating abstract knowledge such as information about what objects are what they are for and how they are typically used the most powerful ai systems like watson () use techniques like deep learning as just one element in a very complicated ensemble of techniques ranging from the statistical technique of bayesian inference to deductive reasoning[]
in further reference to the idea that artistic sensitivity might be inherent in relatively low levels of the cognitive hierarchy a published series of graphic representations of the internal states of deep (- layers) neural networks attempting to discern within essentially random data the images on which they were trained[] demonstrate a visual appeal: the original research notice received well over  comments and was the subject of what was for a time the most frequently accessed article on the guardian's[] website
while deep learning consists of dozens and even hundreds of layers that architecture doesn't seem to resemble the structure of the brain simulations on shallow networks which are closer to the brain dynamics indicate a similar performance as deep learning with a lower complexity[][]
errors
some deep learning architectures display problematic behaviors[] such as confidently classifying unrecognizable images as belonging to a familiar category of ordinary images ()[] and misclassifying minuscule perturbations of correctly classified images ()[] goertzel hypothesized that these behaviors are due to limitations in their internal representations and that these limitations would inhibit integration into heterogeneous multi-component artificial general intelligence (agi) architectures[] these issues may possibly be addressed by deep learning architectures that internally form states homologous to image-grammar[] decompositions of observed entities and events[] learning a grammar (visual or linguistic) from training data would be equivalent to restricting the system to commonsense reasoning that operates on concepts in terms of grammatical production rules and is a basic goal of both human language acquisition[] and artificial intelligence (ai)[]
cyber threat
as deep learning moves from the lab into the world research and experience show that artificial neural networks are vulnerable to hacks and deception[] by identifying patterns that these systems use to function attackers can modify inputs to anns in such a way that the ann finds a match that human observers would not recognize for example an attacker can make subtle changes to an image such that the ann finds a match even though the image looks to a human nothing like the search target such manipulation is termed an "adversarial attack"[]
in  researchers used one ann to doctor images in trial and error fashion identify another's focal points and thereby generate images that deceived it the modified images looked no different to human eyes another group showed that printouts of doctored images then photographed successfully tricked an image classification system[] one defense is reverse image search in which a possible fake image is submitted to a site such as tineye that can then find other instances of it a refinement is to search using only parts of the image to identify images from which that piece may have been taken[]
another group showed that certain psychedelic spectacles could fool a facial recognition system into thinking ordinary people were celebrities potentially allowing one person to impersonate another in  researchers added stickers to stop signs and caused an ann to misclassify them[]
anns can however be further trained to detect attempts at deception potentially leading attackers and defenders into an arms race similar to the kind that already defines the malware defense industry anns have been trained to defeat ann-based anti-malware software by repeatedly attacking a defense with malware that was continually altered by a genetic algorithm until it tricked the anti-malware while retaining its ability to damage the target[]
in  another group demonstrated that certain sounds could make the google now voice command system open a particular web address and hypothesized that this could "serve as a stepping stone for further attacks (eg opening a web page hosting drive-by malware)"[]
in "data poisoning" false data is continually smuggled into a machine learning system's training set to prevent it from achieving mastery[]
most deep learning systems rely on training and verification data that is generated and/or annotated by humans[] it has been argued in media philosophy that not only low-paid clickwork (eg on amazon mechanical turk) is regularly deployed for this purpose but also implicit forms of human microwork that are often not recognized as such[] the philosopher rainer mühlhoff distinguishes five types of "machinic capture" of human microwork to generate training data: () gamification (the embedding of annotation or computation tasks in the flow of a game) () "trapping and tracking" (eg captchas for image recognition or click-tracking on google search results pages) () exploitation of social motivations (eg tagging faces on facebook to obtain labeled facial images) () information mining (eg by leveraging quantified-self devices such as activity trackers) and () clickwork[]
muhlhoff argues that in most commercial end-user applications of deep learning such as facebook's face recognition system the need for training data does not stop once an ann is trained rather there is a continued demand for human-generated verification data to constantly calibrate and update the ann for this purpose facebook introduced the feature that once a user is automatically recognized in an image they receive a notification they can choose whether of not they like to be publicly labeled on the image or tell facebook that it is not them in the picture[] this user interface is a mechanism to generate "a constant stream of verification data"[] to further train the network in real-time as mühlhoff argues involvement of human users to generate training and verification data is so typical for most commercial end-user applications of deep learning that such systems may be referred to as "human-aided artificial intelligence"[]
education in india is primarily managed by the state-run public education system which falls under the command of the government at three levels: central state and local under various articles of the indian constitution and the right of children to free and compulsory education act  free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged  to  the approximate ratio of the total number of public schools to private schools in india is :[]
education in india covers different levels and types of learning such as early childhood education primary education secondary education higher education and vocational education it varies significantly according to different factors such as location (urban or rural) gender caste religion language and disability
education in india faces many challenges and opportunities such as improving access and quality reducing disparities and dropouts increasing enrolment and completion rates enhancing learning outcomes and employability strengthening governance and accountability promoting innovation and technology and addressing the impact of covid- pandemic it is influenced by various policies and programmes at the national and state levels such as the national education policy  the samagra shiksha abhiyan the rashtriya madhyamik shiksha abhiyan the midday meal scheme the beti bachao beti padhao scheme and the national digital education architecture it is also supported by various stakeholders and partners such as unicef unesco world bank civil society organizations academic institutions private sector entities and media outlets
education system
up until  under the indian constitution school education was a state subject; states possessed full jurisdiction over making and implementing education policies after the nd amendment of the constitution of india was passed in  education fell under the concurrent list[] this allowed the central government to recommend education policies and programmes even if state governments continued to wield extensive autonomy in implementing these programmes[] in a country as large as india now with  states and eight union territories this has created vast differences between states in terms of their policies plans programmes and initiatives relating to school education periodically national policy frameworks are created to guide states in their creation of state-level programs and policies state governments and local government bodies manage the majority of primary and upper primary schools and the number of government-managed elementary schools is growing simultaneously the number and proportion managed by private bodies is growing in -  of schools offering elementary education (grades –) were managed by government and  of schools were under private management (excluding children in unrecognised schools schools established under the education guarantee scheme and in alternative learning centers) of those schools managed privately one third are 'aided' and two thirds are 'unaided' enrolment in grades – is shared between government and privately managed schools in the ratio : however in rural areas this ratio is higher (:) and in urban areas much lower (:)[]
in the  census about  of the population was literate with  for males and  for females national statistical commission surveyed literacy to be  in –  for male and  for female[] this compares to  when the respective rates were   and  in  the rates were   and [] india's improved education system is often cited as one of the main contributors to its economic development[][] much of the progress especially in higher education and scientific research has been credited to various public institutions while enrolment in higher education has increased steadily over the past decade reaching a gross enrolment ratio (ger) of  in [] there still remains a significant distance to catch up with tertiary education enrolment levels of developed nations[] a challenge that will be necessary to overcome in order to continue to reap a demographic dividend from india's comparatively young population[citation needed]
demand for private schools has been growing over the years[]while a consensus over what is the most significant driver of this growth in private schooling has not yet emerged some authors have attributed this to a higher demand for english-medium education[] a dissatisfaction with the quality of public schools[][] greater affordability of private schools[] and non-availability of preferred field of study in government schools[] after the adoption of the right to education (rte) act  private schools were required to be 'government-recognised' a private school would be eligible for government recognition when it met certain conditions[]
at the primary and secondary level india has a large private school system complementing the government run schools with  of students receiving private education in the  to  age group[] certain post-secondary technical schools are also private the private education market in india had a revenue of us million in  but is projected to be a us billion market[]
as per the annual status of education report (aser)   of all rural children between the ages of – were enrolled in school this is the fourth annual survey to report enrolment above  india has maintained an average enrolment ratio of  for students in this age group from year  to  as an outcome the number of students in the age group – who are not enrolled in school has come down to  in the academic year  (aser )[] another report from  stated that there were  million students enrolled in different accredited urban and rural schools of india from class i to xii representing an increase of  million students over  total enrolment and a  increase in girl's enrolment[] while quantitatively india is inching closer to universal education the quality of its education has been questioned particularly in its government run school system while more than  per cent of children attend primary school just  per cent of indian adolescents attend secondary school (grades –) since  the world bank has committed over  billion to education in india some of the reasons for the poor quality include absence of around  of teachers every day[] states of india have introduced tests and education assessment system to identify and improve such schools[] the human rights measurement initiative finds that india is achieving only  of what should be possible at its level of income for the right to education[]
although there are private schools in india they are highly regulated in terms of what they can teach in what form they can operate (must be a non-profit to run any accredited educational institution) and all the other aspects of the operation hence the differentiation between government schools and private schools can be misleading[] however in a report by geeta gandhi kingdon entitled: the emptying of public schools and growth of private schools in india it is said that for sensible education-policy making it is vital to take account of the various changing trends in the size of the private and public schooling sectors in india ignoring these trends involves the risk of poor policies/legislation with adverse effects on children's education[citation needed]
in january  india had over  universities and  colleges[] in india's higher education system a significant number of seats are reserved under affirmative action policies for the historically disadvantaged scheduled castes and scheduled tribes and other backward classes in universities colleges and similar institutions affiliated to the central government there is a maximum  of reservations applicable to these disadvantaged groups at the state level it can vary maharashtra had  reservation in  which is the highest percentage of reservations in india[][][][]

early education in india commenced under the supervision of a guru or preceptor after initiation[] the education was delivered through gurukula the relationship between the guru and his shishya (students /disciples) was a very important part of education[] takshasila (in modern-day pakistan) is one of the example of ancient higher learning institute in india from possibly th century bce however it is debatable whether it could be regarded a university or not in modern sense since teachers living there may not have had official membership of particular colleges and there did not seem to have existed purpose-built lecture halls and residential quarters in a taxila in contrast to the later nalanda university in eastern india nalanda was the oldest university-system of education in the world in the modern sense of university there all subjects were taught in the pali language[]
secular institutions cropped up along buddhist monasteries these institutions imparted practical education eg medicine a number of urban learning centres became increasingly visible from the period between  bce to  ce the important urban centers of learning were nalanda (in modern-day bihar) and manassa in nagpur among others[citation needed] these institutions systematically imparted knowledge and attracted a number of foreign students to study topics such as buddhist páli literature logic páli grammar etc chanakya a brahmin teacher was among the most famous teachers associated with founding of mauryan empire[citation needed][where]
shramanas and brahmanas historically offered education by means of donations rather than charging fees or the procurement of funds from students or their guardians[citation needed] later stupas temples also became centers of education; religious education was compulsory but secular subjects were also taught students were required to be brahmacaris or celibates the knowledge in these orders was often related to the tasks a section of the society had to perform arts crafts ayurveda architecture were taught
with the advent of islam in india the traditional methods of education increasingly came under islamic influence[] pre-mughal rulers such as qutb-ud-din aybak and other muslim rulers initiated institutions which imparted religious knowledge[] scholars such as nizamuddin auliya and moinuddin chishti became prominent educators and established islamic monasteries[] students from bukhara and afghanistan visited india to study humanities and science[] islamic institution of education in india included traditional madrassas and maktabs which taught grammar philosophy mathematics and law influenced by the greek traditions inherited by persia and the middle east before islam spread from these regions into india[] a feature of this traditional islamic education was its emphasis on the connection between science and humanities[]
british rule and the subsequent establishment of educational institutions saw the introduction of english as a medium of instruction some schools taught the curriculum through vernacular languages with english as a second language the term "pre-modern" was used for three kinds of schools – the arabic and sanskrit schools which taught muslim or hindu sacred literature and the persian schools which taught persian literature the vernacular schools across india taught reading and writing the vernacular language and arithmetic[] british education became solidified into india as missionary schools were established during the s[]

school boards set the curriculum conduct standardised exams mostly at th and th level to award the school diplomas exams at the remaining levels (also called standard grade or class denoting the years of schooling) are conducted by the schools
national council of educational research and training (ncert): the ncert is the apex body located at new delhi capital city of india it makes the curriculum related matters for school education across india[] the ncert provides support guidance and technical assistance to a number of schools in india and oversees many aspects of enforcement of education policies[] there are other curriculum bodies governing school education system specially at state level called scerts
state government boards of education: most of the state governments have at least one "state board of secondary school education" however some states like andhra pradesh have more than one also the union territories do not have a board chandigarh dadra and nagar haveli daman and diu and lakshadweep and puducherry lakshadweep share the services with a larger state the boards set curriculum from grades  to  for affiliated schools the curriculum varies from state to state and has more local appeal with examinations conducted in regional languages in addition to english – often considered less rigorous than national curricula such as cbse or icse/isc most of these conduct exams at th and th level but some even at the th and th level
central board of secondary education (cbse): the cbse sets curriculum from grades  to  for affiliated schools and conducts examinations at the th and th levels students studying the cbse curriculum take the all india secondary school examination (aisse) at the end of grade  and all india senior school certificate examination (aissce) at the end of grade  examinations are offered in hindi and english
council for the indian school certificate examinations (cisce): cisce sets curriculum from grades  to  for affiliated schools and conducts three examinations namely the indian certificate of secondary education (icse – class/grade ); the indian school certificate (isc – class/grade ) and the certificate in vocational education (cve – class/grade ) cisce english level has been compared to uk's a-levels; this board offers more choices of subjects cbse exams at grade  and  have often been compared with icse and isc examinations respectively icse is generally considered to be more rigorous than the cbse aisse (grade ) but the cbse aissce and isc examinations are almost on par with each other in most subjects with isc including a slightly more rigorous english examination than the cbse th grade examination the cbse and isc are recognised internationally and most universities abroad accept the final results of cbse and isc exams for admissions purposes and as proof of completion of secondary school
national institute of open schooling (nios): the nios conducts two examinations namely secondary examination and senior secondary examination (all india) and also some courses in vocational education national board of education is run by government of india's hrd ministry to provide education in rural areas and challenged groups in open and distance education mode a pilot project started by cbse to provide high class affordable education provides education up to th standard choice of subjects is highly customisable and equivalent to cbse home-schooled students usually take nios or international curriculum examinations as they are ineligible to write cbse or isc exams

the pre-primary stage is the foundation of children's knowledge skills and behaviour on completion of pre-primary education the children are sent to the primary stage but pre-primary education in india is not a fundamental right in rural india pre-primary schools are rarely available in small villages but in cities and big towns there are many established players in the pre-primary education sector the demand for the preschools is growing considerably in the smaller towns and cities but still only  of the population under age  is enrolled in preschool education
play group (pre-nursery): at playschools children are exposed to a lot of basic learning activities that help them to get independent faster and develop their self-help qualities like eating food themselves dressing up and maintaining cleanliness the age limit for admission into pre-nursery is  to  years anganwadi is government-funded free rural childcare & mothercare nutrition and learning program also incorporating the free midday meal scheme[]
nursery: nursery level activities help children unfold their talents thus enabling them to sharpen their mental and physical abilities the age limit for admission in nursery is  to  years
lower kindergarten: it is also called the junior kindergarten (jr kg) stage the age limit for admission in lkg is  to  years
upper kindergarten: it is also called the senior kindergarten (sr kg) stage the age limit for admission in ukg is  to  years
lkg and ukg stages prepare and help children emotionally mentally socially and physically to grasp knowledge easily in the later stages of school and college life[] a systematic process of preschool education is followed in india to impart knowledge in the best possible way for a better understanding of the young children by following an easy and interesting curriculum teachers strive hard to make the entire learning process enjoyable for the children

the primary education in india is divided into two parts namely lower primary (class i-v) and upper primary (middle school class vi-viii) the indian government lays emphasis on primary education (class i-viii) also referred to as elementary education to children aged  to  years old[] because education laws are given by the states duration of primary school visit alters between the indian states the indian government has also banned child labour in order to ensure that the children do not enter unsafe working conditions[] however both free education and the ban on child labour are difficult to enforce due to economic disparity and social conditions[]  of all recognised schools at the elementary stage are government run or supported making it the largest provider of education in the country[] figures released by the indian government in  show that there were  elementary school teachers in india[] as of march  there were  secondary school teachers in india[] education has also been made free[] for children for  to  years of age or up to class viii under the right of children to free and compulsory education act [] while school enrollment rates have increased many children leave school with poor literacy and numeracy skills aser reported in  that only  of fifth standard students in rural india could read a standard ii-level text and only  of them could do basic division[]
however due to a shortage of resources and lack of political will this system suffers from massive gaps including high pupil to teacher ratios shortage of infrastructure and poor levels of teacher training some scholars have used the concept of "visibility" to explain why successive governments have underprioritised investments directed at raising the quality of teaching and education in india relative to investments in building more schools[][] building schools is more "visible" to the voting public and easily attributable to the government; training teachers to teach better and raising the quality of education is a more uncertain venture the success of which is determined by factors outside the control of any one government[] this incentivises governments to focus their resources on "visible" areas of intervention
there have been several efforts to enhance quality made by the government the district education revitalisation programme (derp) was launched in  with an aim to universalise primary education in india by reforming and vitalising the existing primary education system[]  of the derp was funded by the central government and the remaining  was funded by the states[] the derp which had opened  new schools including  alternative education schools delivering alternative education to approximately  million children was also supported by unicef and other international programs "corruption hurts the poor disproportionately – by diverting funds intended for development undermining a government's ability to provide basic services feeding inequality and injustice and discouraging foreign investment and aid" (kofi annan in his statement on the adoption of the united nations convention against corruption by the general assembly ny november )[] in january  kerala became the st indian state to achieve  primary education through its literacy programme athulyam[]
this primary education scheme has also shown a high gross enrolment ratio of – for the last three years in some states[] significant improvement in staffing and enrolment of girls has also been made as a part of this scheme[] the scheme for universalisation of education for all is the sarva shiksha abhiyan which is one of the largest education initiatives in the world while school enrolment rates have increased the quality of education received by students remains low the literature suggests that one of the biggest reasons for quality deficiencies in primary and secondary education is teacher absence and negligence in one popular study the researchers made unannounced visits to  schools in  major indian states where they found that on average  of government primary school teachers absent every day[] in another study although it was found that three-quarters of the teachers were in attendance in the government primary schools that were inspected only half of them were found teaching[]
secondary education

secondary education covers children aged  to  a group comprising  million children according to the  census of india the final two years of secondary is often called higher secondary (hs) senior secondary intermediate or simply the "+" stage the two-halves of secondary education are each an important stage for which a pass certificate is needed and thus are affiliated by boards of education under education ministry before one can pursue higher education including college or professional courses
ugc ncert cbse and icse directives state qualifying ages for candidates who wish to take the standardised exams those at least  years old by  may for a given academic year are eligible to appear for secondary school certificate exams and those  by the same date are eligible to appear for higher secondary certificate exams it is further stated that upon successful completion of higher secondary one can apply to higher education under ugc control
secondary education in india is examination-oriented and not course-based: students register for and take classes primarily to prepare for one of the centrally-administered examinations secondary school is split into  parts (grades – and grades –) with a standardised nationwide examination at the end of grade  and grade  (colloquially referred to as "board exams") grade  examination results can be used for admission into grades – at a secondary school pre-university program or a vocational or technical school passing the grade  board examination leads to the granting of a secondary school completion diploma which may be used for admission into vocational schools or universities in the country or the world
most schools in india do not offer subject and scheduling flexibility due to budgeting constraints (for example students in india are often not allowed to take chemistry and history in grades – as they are part of different "streams") private candidates (that is not studying in a school) are generally not allowed to register for and take board examinations but there are some exceptions such as nios
students taking the grade  examination usually take five or six subjects: two languages(at least one of them being english/hindi) mathematics science(often taught as three separate disciplines: physics chemistry and biology; but assessed as a single subject) social sciences (consisting of four components assessed as a single subject: history geography economics and political science) and one optional subject depending on the availability of teachers elective or optional subjects often include computer applications commerce painting music and home science
students taking the grade  examination usually take five or six subjects with english or the local language being compulsory students re-enrolling in most secondary schools after grade  have to make the choice of choosing subjects from a "core stream" in addition to the language: science (mathematics biology physics chemistry computer science biotechnology physical education) commerce (accountancy business studies economics entrepreneurship informatics practices marketing retail financial market management) or humanities (history political science sociology psychology geography legal studies fine arts music dance) depending on the school students with the science stream study mathematics up to single-variable calculus in grade 
most reputable universities in india require students to pass college-administered admissions tests in addition to passing a final secondary school examination for entry into a college or university school grades are usually not sufficient for college admissions in india popular entrance tests include jee neet and the recent cuet
types of schools
government schools
the majority of indian children attend government run schools education is free socially and economically for children until the age of  an education ministry data from  showed that  ( million) of all school students in  states attend government schools (c )[] these include schools runs by the state and local government as well as the central government example of large center government run school systems are kendriya vidyalaya in urban areas jawahar navodaya vidyalaya for the gifted students kasturba gandhi balika vidyalaya for girls belonging to vulnerable sc/st/obc classes and indian army public schools run by the indian army for the children of military personnel
kendriya vidyalaya project was started for the employees of the central government of india who are deployed throughout the country the government started the kendriya vidyalaya project in  to provide uniform education in institutions following the same syllabus at the same pace regardless of the location to which the employee's family has been transferred[]

la martiniere calcutta a private school in kolkata
most middle-class families send their children to private schools[] mostly in their own city but also at boarding schools private schools have been established since the british rule in india and st george's school chennai is the oldest private school in india[] at such schools the medium of education is often english but hindi and/or the state's official language is also taught as a compulsory subject[] pre-school education is mostly limited to organised neighbourhood nursery schools with some organised chains[] montessori education is also popular due to maria montessori's stay in india during world war ii in  four of the top ten pre-schools in chennai were montessori[]
many privately owned and managed schools carry the appellation "public" such as the delhi public schools or frank anthony public schools these are modelled after british public schools which are a group of older expensive and exclusive fee-paying private independent schools in england
according to some research private schools often provide superior results at a multiple of the unit cost of government schools the reason being high aims and better vision[][][] however others have suggested that private schools fail to provide education to the poorest families a selective being only a fifth of the schools and have in the past ignored court orders for their regulation[citation needed] research with children from the same family in which one child attends private school and the other receives a government education has found barely any difference in their attainment this has led some analysts to argue that the better test scores achieved by private schools in general is primarily a result of 'background advantages' enjoyed by privately educated children because they tend come from wealthier families than their government-educated peers such advantages may for example include having more educational resources at home[]
in their favour it has been pointed out that private schools cover the entire curriculum and offer extra-curricular activities such as science fairs general knowledge sports music and drama[] the pupil teacher ratios are much better in private schools (: to : for government schools) and more teachers in private schools are female[citation needed] there is some disagreement over which system has better educated teachers according to the latest dise survey the percentage of untrained teachers (para-teachers) is  in private compared to  in government schools and only  teachers in unaided schools receive in-service training compared to  for government schools the competition in the school market is intense yet most schools make profit[] however the number of private schools in india is still low – the share of private institutions is  (with upper primary being  secondary  – source: fortress team research) even the poorest often go to private schools despite the fact that government schools are free a study found that  school-children in hyderabad's slums attend private schools[]
as of january  the international schools consultancy (isc)[] listed india as having  international schools[] isc defines an 'international school' in the following terms "isc includes an international school if the school delivers a curriculum to any combination of pre-school primary or secondary students wholly or partly in english outside an english-speaking country or if a school in a country where english is one of the official languages offers an english-medium curriculum other than the country's national curriculum and is international in its orientation"[] this definition is used by publications including the economist[]
home-schooling
home-schooling in india is legal though it is the less explored option and often debated by educators the indian government's stance on the issue is that parents are free to teach their children at home if they wish to and have the means the then hrd minister kapil sibal has stated that despite the rte act of  if someone decides not to send his/her children to school the government would not interfere[]
non-governmental work in education
ngo work in indian education broadly spans four areas – piloting approaches to multigrade teaching making improvements to learning environments teacher training and support and creating stronger school-community links[]
ngo involvement in education has been crucial in delivering targeted action to under resourced communities such as scheduled castes scheduled tribes the urban poor children engaged in child labor children with disabilities etc the sarva shiksha abhiyan (ssa) recognized the role played by ngos in ensuring access to education particularly for students with disabilities[] ngos contributed to ssa by either leading advocacy movements for persons with disabilities or providing various types of assistance in rural settings for children with disabilities[][]
under the ssa ngos also engaged in collaboration with the state to reach children excluded from mainstream education including migrant children child laborers dropouts children living in areas with civil instability and girls[] there are  registered ngos working in the areas of education and literacy[] partnerships under the ssa can occur through funding by central and state governments funding activities by identified national and state resource institutions or through participation in community activities of various village education committees[]
grassroots education ngos often deliver services via local governing institutions such as the panchayati raj and emphasize community participation in ensuring quality[] the mamidipudi venkatarangaiya foundation (mvf) established in  to address literacy among child laborers utilized parent teacher associations to disburse seed money for the program under the supervision of the village panchayat which then took issues of staffing shortage and insufficient infrastructure to the state government[] the pratham educational initiative in delhi and mumbai works with the integrated child development scheme to set up and provide support to community-run pre-school centers or balwadis under the namma shaale project in karnataka the azim premji foundation identified seven key stakeholders (children teachers parents school development and monitoring committees community based organizations gram panchayats and education managers) in their work to establish a framework of school-community leadership[]
ngos also work with the state to enable teacher training there have been a number of ngo partnerships with local district institute of educational training the rishi valley institute for educational resources (river) has worked with school districts in many indian states to provide multi-grade multi-level training approaches catering to the needs of remote one-room schools[] the eklavya foundation in madhya pradesh has been working with the state council for education research and training since  to train teachers in making learning a joyful experience by emphasizing skill development and practical learning in the sciences
ngos have historically been associated with non-formal education (nfe) programs both in providing alternative pedagogical approaches as well as substitutes to mainstream education[] the bharat gyan vigyan samiti for instance emphasizes "science and literacy for national integration and self-reliance"[] and uses approaches such as the gyan vigyan vidyalayas to encourage long-term engagement in literacy[]
studies in ngo involvement in education have criticized the adoption of ngo models into formal schooling as low-cost options that require institutional mechanisms to avoid undermining the state's financial responsibility in providing elementary education[] the cost‐effectiveness of ngo programs has yet to be determined in studies that demonstrate that ngos are more cost-effective in the global south there have been concerns raised that this is accomplished by cutting ethical corners such as underpayment of ngo workers[]

some institutions of india such as the indian institutes of technology (iits) and national institutes of technology (nits) have been globally acclaimed for their standard of under-graduate education in engineering several other institutes of fundamental research such as the indian institute of science (iisc) indian association for the cultivation of science (iacs) tata institute of fundamental research (tifr) harish-chandra research institute (hri) jawaharlal nehru centre for advanced scientific research (jncasr) indian institute of science education and research (iiser) are also acclaimed for their standard of research in basic sciences and mathematics however india has failed to produce world class universities both in the private sector or the public sector[]
besides top rated universities which provide highly competitive world class education to their pupils india is also home to many universities which have been founded with the sole objective of making easy money regulatory authorities like ugc and aicte have been trying very hard to extirpate the menace of private universities which are running courses without any affiliation or recognition indian government has failed to check on these education shops which are run by big businessmen & politicians many private colleges and universities do not fulfil the required criterion by the government and central bodies (ugc aicte mci bci etc) and take students for a ride for example many institutions in india continue to run unaccredited courses as there is no legislation strong enough to ensure legal action against them quality assurance mechanisms have failed to stop misrepresentations and malpractices in higher education at the same time regulatory bodies have been accused of corruption specifically in the case of deemed-universities[] in this context of lack of solid quality assurance mechanism institutions need to step-up and set higher standards of self-regulation[]
our university system is in many parts in a state of disrepairin almost half the districts in the country higher education enrollments are abysmally low almost two-third of our universities and  of our colleges are rated as below average on quality parameters i am concerned that in many states university appointments including that of vice-chancellors have been politicised and have become subject to caste and communal considerations there are complaints of favouritism and corruption

institution of mechanical engineers (india)
institution of chemical engineering (india)
institution of electronics and tele-communication engineers (india)
indian institute of metals

that conduct engineering/technical examinations at different levels (degree and diploma) for working professionals desirous of improving their technical qualifications
the number of graduates coming out of technical colleges increased to over  in  from  in fy [][] however according to one study  of technical graduates and more than  of general graduates lack the skills needed in india's most demanding and high-growth global industries such as information technology[] these high-tech global information technologies companies directly or indirectly employ about  million people less than  of india's labour pool[] india offers one of the largest pool of technically skilled graduates in the world given the sheer numbers of students seeking education in engineering science and mathematics india faces daunting challenges in scaling up capacity while maintaining quality[][]
structure of school education
the school education structure in india typically follows a + system which consists of  years of primary and secondary education followed by two years of higher secondary education however it's important to note that educational practices can vary across different states and education boards in india[][][]
pre-primary / elementary education

science: this stream focuses on subjects such as physics chemistry biology mathematics and computer science
commerce: this stream includes subjects like accountancy economics business studies and mathematics
arts/humanities: students in this stream study subjects like history political science sociology economics and languages
upon completing their pre-university education students can choose to pursue higher education at universities professional colleges or other specialized institutions in the rest of the states in india including the central education boards like cbse (central board of secondary education) and cisce (council for the indian school certificate examinations) the education system follows a + format it consists of ten years of primary and secondary education (up to the th grade) followed by two years of higher secondary education (th and th grade)
vocational education
in addition to the regular academic curriculum vocational education is offered at various stages to provide specific skills and training in fields such as engineering information technology hospitality healthcare and more vocational courses are available at both the secondary and higher secondary levels
it's important to note that educational practices syllabus and examinations may vary depending on the education board such as cbse cisce state boards or international boards additionally there are alternative education systems in india such as the international baccalaureate (ib) and cambridge international examinations (cie) which follow different curricula and assessment methods
higher education: after completing higher secondary or intermediate education students can pursue higher education in colleges and universities higher education options include undergraduate programs (bachelor's degrees) postgraduate programs (master's degrees) and doctoral programs (phd)
open and distance learning
open schooling is refers to a system of education that allows individuals to pursue their education through flexible and open learning methods it is primarily targeted at students who are unable to attend regular schools due to various reasons such as work commitments financial constraints or other personal circumstances[][][][] the national institute of open schooling (nios) is the largest open schooling system in india it operates under the aegis of the ministry of education government of india nios offers various academic and vocational courses at the secondary (th) and senior secondary (th) levels it follows a learner-centric approach and provides education through open and distance learning methods apart from nios some states like kerala have their own open schooling boards that provide similar opportunities for flexible learning and certification the certificates and qualifications offered by nios or state open education boards are recognized by various educational institutions colleges and universities in india and abroad they hold the same value as certificates obtained through regular schooling at the school level board of open schooling and skill education sikkim (bosse) national institute of open schooling (nios) provides opportunities for continuing education to those who missed completing school education  million students are enrolled at the secondary and higher secondary level through open and distance learning[] in  various state governments also introduced "state open school" to provide distance education[]

deaf education in india
history of education in india for the dhh population
india is very diverse with eight main religions hundreds of ethnic groups and  languages with hundreds of dialects[] this diversity has made it difficult to educate deaf or hard of hearing (dhh) people in india for generations[]
there is a history of educating the deaf in india however there is no single clear approach to their education[] this stems from conditions some similar to those faced around the world and others unique to india[] for example prior to independence of india there were not clear laws and protections for the disabled[] since independence advancements have been made for rights of the disabled but this has not fully tackled the issue[]
pre-independence there were only  schools for the deaf in india and all of these used an oral approach[] the belief was that using sign language would hinder advancements of hearing and speaking in deaf children[] additionally there was no single indian sign language so signs would differ depending on where the school was located[]
post-independence there are more services and resources available for dhh people however challenges with education remain[] there are organizations around the country that work to advance the spread and quality of education for the deaf[]
education for dhh children
oralism and the use of sign language are two competing approaches to education for dhh people[] while oralism dominates in india which is an approach that encourages speaking and hearing it is usually not realistic for dhh children[]
there is an indian sign language however it is not formally recognized by the government and it is not complete or comprehensive[] it varies around the country and is not encouraged by professionals and educators[] beliefs of the past that the use of sign language will hinder the potential advancements of hearing and speaking in dhh children remain[] in recent years there has been a notion to encourage the use of sign language in india and teach it in schools[] in  the first isl dictionary was released[]
due to these challenges and beliefs associated with sign language education for dhh people in india often focuses on teaching children to hear speak and read lips this is known as an oral approach[]
in india there are regular schools and special schools[] special schools provide education for children with different disabilities[] special schools can be beneficial to dhh children and provide a better education than they would receive in a regular school[] however these schools aren't available for every deaf child[] sometimes they are located too far from a child's home[] another reason a child may have to attend a regular school is if they receive hearing technology[] since india focuses on hearing and speaking for the deaf hearing technology is encouraged[] once a child receives hearing technology it is believed that they can attend regular schools[] even with hearing technology dhh children still need special education in order to succeed[] this puts them at a significant disadvantage in regular school and can cause them to fall behind academically linguistically and developmentally[] for these reasons many deaf children receive poor education or no education at all causing the illiteracy rate of deaf children to rise[]
education in india in regular schools and deaf schools has problems[] even in deaf schools sign language isn't usually taught and used[] some use a small amount of sign language but all of the deaf schools in india use or claim to use an oral approach[] some deaf schools secretly teach sign language due to the stigma and beliefs surrounding the use of sign language and disability in general in india[] children in deaf schools have to try to learn by hearing or reading lips and writing[] in hearing schools the children have to do the same[] there are no special accommodations additionally there aren't any teachers that use sign language in regular schools (maybe a few in deaf schools) and there aren't any interpreters[]
there are a couple of hundred deaf schools in india and vocational training is becoming more common for dhh people[]
higher education
there are no deaf colleges or universities in india a person's education ends with grade school- where they likely weren't able to learn[] with lack of education dhh people then have a very difficult time finding a job[]
there is one interpreter in one college in india delhi university[]

wheebox publishes india skills report to examine the strategic overview of india’s skills and talent economy the report highlights the employability factor among men and women and the skills required to be employable it also sheds light on hiring trends in various sectors
employment among women
employability rate of women –  employability rate of men –  the rise in employability however does not reflect in an increase in female labor force participation this is due to socio-cultural norms and hiring bias
state that has the largest number of employable females – rajasthan uttar pradesh and andhra pradesh; state that has the largest number of employable males – odisha delhi and jammu & kashmir female labor force participation in the formal economy is  as against  for men this is significantly lower than its south asian peers women hold only  of total stem jobs they account for only  of researchers  of professionals working in artificial intelligence and  of engineering students across the world
according to wheebox skills you need to get employable by 
digital literacy – employees should have the ability to operate hardware and software and applications with self-assurance and safety
data literacy – the requirement is rising to have data skills where employees can measure and interpret data to accelerate the company’s goal
critical thinking – at the age of information overburden critical thinking skills are sought in brainstorming ideas and implementing them in a problem-solving nature
emotional intelligence – handling emotions and channeling them to complete a project will be an important skill to have for all employees across sectors
creativity – this will be a valuable skill as the indian economy continues to delegate mundane tasks to automated systems[][][]
curriculum issues
modern education in india is often criticised for being based on rote learning rather than problem solving[][] anil k rajvanshi writes that indian education system seems to be producing zombies since in most of the schools students seemed to be spending majority of their time in preparing for competitive exams rather than learning or playing[] preschool for child rights states that almost  of pre-schools do not have any curriculum at all[] also creativity is not encouraged or is considered a form of entertainment in most institutions[]
the british "essentialist" view of knowledge of the nineteenth century emphasised the individual scientific universal and moral aims of education ahead of the social and cultural this combined with the colonial construction of indian society designed to preserve the ideological lead of the empire post- it helped shape the official nineteenth-century school curriculum the rejection of nationalist gopal krishna gokhale's bill () to make primary education free and compulsory by the colonial administration and english-educated and often upper-caste elite further helped sustain a curriculum that focused on colonial objectives holmes and mclean ( ) argues that despite tensions between the colonial view of education and the nationalist postcolonial aims of education british essentialism grew unassailable roots in india partly because "colonial values coincided with those of indigenous traditions"[]
rural education

following independence india viewed education as an effective tool for bringing social change through community development[] the administrative control was effectively initiated in the s when in  the government grouped villages under a community development block—an authority under a national programme which could control education in up to  villages[] a block development officer oversaw a geographical area of  square miles ( km) which could contain a population of as many as  people[]
setty and ross elaborate on the role of such programmes themselves divided further into individual-based community based or the individual-cum-community-based in which microscopic levels of development are overseen at village level by an appointed worker:
the community development programmes comprise agriculture animal husbandry cooperation rural industries rural engineering (consisting of minor irrigation roads buildings) health and sanitation including family welfare family planning women welfare child care and nutrition education including adult education social education and literacy youth welfare and community organisation in each of these areas of development there are several programmes schemes and activities which are additive expanding and tapering off covering the total community some segments or specific target populations such as small and marginal farmers artisans women and in general people below the poverty line[]
despite some setbacks the rural education programmes continued throughout the s with support from private institutions[] a sizeable network of rural education had been established by the time the gandhigram rural institute was established and  community development blocks were established in india[] nursery schools elementary schools secondary school and schools for adult education for women were set up[]
the government continued to view rural education as an agenda that could be relatively free from bureaucratic backlog and general stagnation[] however in some cases lack of financing balanced the gains made by rural education institutes of india[] some ideas failed to find acceptability among india's poor and investments made by the government sometimes yielded little results[] today government rural schools remain poorly funded and understaffed several foundations such as the rural development foundation (hyderabad) actively build high-quality rural schools but the number of students served is small
education in rural india is valued differently from in an urban setting with lower rates of completion an imbalanced sex ratio exists within schools with  of males earning a high school diploma compared with only  of females the estimated number of children who have never attended school in india is near  million which reflects the low completion levels[citation needed] this is the largest concentration in the world of youth who haven't enrolled in school[][][][]

the number of literate women among the female population of india was between – from the british raj onward to the formation of the republic of india in [] concerted efforts led to improvement from  in  to  in [] by  literacy for women had exceeded  of the overall female population though these statistics were still very low compared to world standards and even male literacy within india[] recently the indian government has launched saakshar bharat mission for female literacy this mission aims to bring down female illiteracy by half of its present level
sita anantha raman outlines the progress of women's education in india:
since  the indian government has tried to provide incentives for girls' school attendance through programmes for midday meals free books and uniforms this welfare thrust raised primary enrollment between  and  in  the national policy on education decided to restructure education in tune with the social framework of each state and with larger national goals it emphasised that education was necessary for democracy and central to the improvement of women's condition the new policy aimed at social change through revised texts curricula increased funding for schools expansion in the numbers of schools and policy improvements emphasis was placed on expanding girls' occupational centres and primary education; secondary and higher education; and rural and urban institutions the report tried to connect problems like low school attendance with poverty and the dependence on girls for housework and sibling day care the national literacy mission also worked through female tutors in villages although the minimum marriage age is now eighteen for girls many continue to be married much earlier therefore at the secondary level female drop-out rates are high[]
sita anantha raman also mentions that while the educated indian women workforce maintains professionalism the men outnumber them in most fields and in some cases receive higher income for the same positions[]
the education of women in india plays a significant role in improving livings standards in the country[citation needed] a higher female literacy rate improves the quality of life both at home and outside the home by encouraging and promoting education of children especially female children and in reducing the infant mortality rate[citation needed] several studies have shown that a lower level of women literacy rates results in higher levels of fertility and infant mortality poorer nutrition lower earning potential and the lack of an ability to make decisions within a household[][citation needed] women's lower educational levels is also shown to adversely affect the health and living conditions of children[citation needed] a survey that was conducted in india showed results which support the fact that infant mortality rate was inversely related to female literacy rate and educational level[] the survey also suggests a correlation between education and economic growth
in india there is a large disparity between female literacy rates in different states[] state of kerala has the highest female literacy rate of  while rajasthan has the lowest female literacy rate of [][] this correlates to the health levels of states kerala has average life expectancy at birth of  while rajasthan's average life expectancy at birth is  years[]

in the indian education system a teacher's success is loosely defined it is either based on a student's success or based on the years of teaching experience both of which do not necessarily correlate to a teacher's skill set or competencies the management of an institution could thereby be forced to promote teachers based on the grade level they teach or their seniority both of which are often not an indicator of a good teacher[] this means that either a primary school teacher is promoted to a higher grade or a teacher is promoted to take up other roles within the institution such as head of department coordinator vice principal or principal however the skills and competencies that are required for each of them vary and a great teacher may not be a great manager since teachers do not see their own growth and success in their own hands they often do not take up any professional development thus there is a need to identify a framework to help a teacher chart a career path based on his/her own competency and help them understand their own development[]

legislative framework
article  of the constitution of india originally stated:
the state shall endeavour to provide within a period of ten years from the commencement of this constitution for free and compulsory education for all children until they complete the age of fourteen years[]
this article was a directive principle of state policy within india effectively meaning that it was within a set of rules that were meant to be followed in spirit and the government could not be held to court if the actual letter was not followed[] however the enforcement of this directive principle became a matter of debate since this principle held obvious emotive and practical value and was legally the only directive principle within the indian constitution to have a time limit[]
following initiatives by the supreme court of india during the s the rd amendment bill suggested three separate amendments to the indian constitution:[]
the constitution of india was amended to include a new article a which read:
the state shall provide free and compulsory education to all children of the age of six to fourteen years in a such manner as the state may by law determine[]
article  was proposed to be substituted by the article which read:
provision for early childhood care and education to children below the age of six years: the state shall endeavour to provide early childhood care and education for all children until they complete the age of sixteen years[]
another article a was to additionally have the clause:
a parent or guardian [shall] provide opportunities for education to his child or as the case may be [a] ward between the age of six to fourteen years[]
the bill was passed unanimously in the lok sabha the lower house of the indian parliament on  november [] it was later passed by the upper house—the rajya sabha—on  may [] after being signed by the president of india the indian constitution was amended formally for the eighty sixth time and the bill came into effect[] since then those between the age of – have a fundamental right to education[]
article  of the constitution of india holds that:
the state shall promote with special care the education and economic interests of the weaker sections of the people and in particular of the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes and shall protect them from social injustice and all forms of social exploitation'[]

central government expenditure on education
as a part of the tenth five-year plan (–) the central government of india outlined an expenditure of  of its total education budget of  billion (us billion) ie  billion (us billion) on elementary education;  ie  billion (us million) on secondary education;  ie  billion (us million) on adult education;  ie  billion (us million) on higher education;  ie  billion (us million) on technical education; and the remaining  ie  billion (us million) on miscellaneous education schemes[]
during the financial year – the central government of india has allocated   crore for the department of school education and literacy which is the main department dealing with primary education in india within this allocation a major share of   crore is for the flagship programme 'sarva siksha abhiyan' however budgetary allocation of   million is considered very low in view of the officially appointed anil bordia committee recommendation of   billion for the year – this higher allocation was required to implement the recent legislation the 'right of children to free and compulsory education act ' in recent times several major announcements have been made for developing the poor state of affairs in the education sector in india the most notable ones being those of the national common minimum programme (ncmp) of the united progressive alliance (upa) government these announcements were: (a) to progressively increase expenditure on education to around  of gdp (b) to support this increase in expenditure on education and to increase the quality of education there would be an imposition of an education cess over all central government taxes (c) to ensure that no one is denied of education due to economic backwardness and poverty (d) to make right to education a fundamental right for all children in the age group – years (e) to universalise education through its flagship programmes such as sarva shiksha abhiyan and midday meal scheme
however even after five years of the implementation of ncmp not much progress has been seen on this front although the country has targeted devoting a  share of its gdp towards the educational sector india's performance has definitely fallen short of expectations expenditure on education has steadily risen from  of gdp in – to  in – and thereafter reached the peak of  in – however it declined to  in – there is a definite need to step up again as a proportion of total government expenditure it has declined from around  in – to around  during the upa's rule even though ideally it should be around  of the total budget a policy brief issued by [network for social accountability (nsa)][] titled "[nsa response to education sector interventions in union budget: upa rule and the education sector]"[] provides a significant revelation of this fact due to a declining priority of education in the public policy paradigm in india there has been an exponential growth in the private expenditure on education also [as per the available information the private out-of-pocket expenditure by the working class population for the education of their children in india has increased by around  percent or around  times over the last decade][]

although it may not be appropriate to judge the adoption of a northern concept in the south from a northern perspective hasty use of such globalised terminology without engaging with the thinking behind it may present no more than empty rhetoric whatever the context[] clearly perceives inclusive education as "…a concept that has been adopted from the international discourse but has not been engaged with in the indian scenario" she supports this view of lack of conceptual engagement through data collected in semi-structured interviews for her phd research where she found that: many interviewees concurred with the opinions reflected in government documents that inclusion is about children with special needs as reflected by a disabling condition a handful of others argue that inclusive education should not be limited to children with disabilities as it holds relevance for all marginalised groups though they were quick to accept that this thinking has not yet prevailed[] indian understandings of disability and educational needs are demonstrated through the interchangeable use of several english terms which hold different meanings in the north for example children with special needs or special educational needs tend to be perceived as children with disabilities in india as demonstrated by mukhopadhyay and mani's () chapter on 'education of children with special needs' in a niepa government-funded research report which solely pertains to children with disabilities in contrast the intention of mary warnock's term 'special educational needs' coined in the uk in  was to imply that any child with an impairment or not may have an individual educational need at some point in their school career (eg dyslexia or language of instruction as a second language) which the teacher should adapt to this further implies that a child with a disability may not have a special educational need while their able-bodied peers could (giffard-lindsay ) in addition despite the  mental health act finally separating the meaning of learning disability from that of mental illness in india there is still some confusion in understanding with the  persons with disabilities act listing both mental retardation and mental illness as categories of disability[] ignorance and fear of genetic inheritance adds to the societal stigma of both 'inclusive' and 'integrated' education are also concepts that are used interchangeably[] understood as the placement of children with disabilities in mainstream classrooms with the provision of aids and appliances and specialist training for the teacher on how to 'deal with' students with disabilities there is little engagement with the connotations of school curriculum and teacher flexibility for all children these rigid categorical interpretations of subtly different northern concepts are perhaps a reflection of not only the government tendency to categories and label[] (julka ; singal a) but also a cultural one most explicitly enforced through the rigidly categorised 
gross domestic product (gdp) is a monetary measure of the market value[] of all the final goods and services produced in a specific time period by a country[] or countries[][][] gdp is most often used by the government of a single country to measure its economic health[] due to its complex and subjective nature this measure is often revised before being considered a reliable indicator[]
gdp definitions are maintained by several national and international economic organizations the organisation for economic co-operation and development (oecd) defines gdp as "an aggregate measure of production equal to the sum of the gross values added of all resident and institutional units engaged in production and services (plus any taxes and minus any subsidies on products not included in the value of their outputs)"[] an imf publication states that "gdp measures the monetary value of final goods and services—that are bought by the final user—produced in a country in a given period (say a quarter or a year)"[]
gdp (nominal) per capita does not however reflect differences in the cost of living and the inflation rates of the countries; therefore using a basis of gdp per capita at purchasing power parity (ppp) may be more useful when comparing living standards between nations while nominal gdp is more useful comparing national economies on the international market[] total gdp can also be broken down into the contribution of each industry or sector of the economy[] the ratio of gdp to the total population of the region is the per capita gdp (also called the mean standard of living)
gdp is often used as a metric for international comparisons as well as a broad measure of economic progress it is often considered to be the world's most powerful statistical indicator of national development and progress however critics of the growth imperative often argue that gdp measures were never intended to measure progress and leave out key other externalities such as resource extraction environmental impact and unpaid domestic work[] critics frequently propose alternative economic models such as doughnut economics which use other measures of success or alternative indicators such as the oecd's better life index as better approaches to measuring the effect of the economy on human development and well being
history
us yoy quarterly gross domestic product growth rate
william petty came up with a basic concept of gdp to attack landlords against unfair taxation during warfare between the dutch and the english between  and [clarification needed][] charles davenant developed the method further in [] the modern concept of gdp was first developed by simon kuznets for a  us congress report where he warned against its use as a measure of welfare (see below under limitations and criticisms)[] after the bretton woods conference in  gdp became the main tool for measuring a country's economy[] at that time gross national product (gnp) was the preferred estimate which differed from gdp in that it measured production by a country's citizens at home and abroad rather than its 'resident institutional units' (see oecd definition above) the switch from gnp to gdp in the united states occurred in  the role that measurements of gdp played in world war ii was crucial to the subsequent political acceptance of gdp values as indicators of national development and progress[] a crucial role was played here by the us department of commerce under milton gilbert where ideas from kuznets were embedded into institutions
the history of the concept of gdp should be distinguished from the history of changes in many ways of estimating it the value added by firms is relatively easy to calculate from their accounts but the value added by the public sector by financial industries and by intangible asset creation is more complex these activities are increasingly important in developed economies and the international conventions governing their estimation and their inclusion or exclusion in gdp regularly change in an attempt to keep up with industrial advances in the words of one academic economist "the actual number for gdp is therefore the product of a vast patchwork of statistics and a complicated set of processes carried out on the raw data to fit them to the conceptual framework"[]
china officially adopted gdp in  as its indicator of economic performance previously china had relied on a marxist-inspired national accounting system[]
determining gross domestic product (gdp)
an infographic explaining how gdp is calculated in the uk
gdp can be determined in three ways all of which should theoretically give the same result they are the production (or output or value added) approach the income approach and the speculated expenditure approach it is representative of the total output and income within an economy
the most direct of the three is the production approach which sums up the outputs of every class of enterprise to arrive at the total the expenditure approach works on the principle that all of the products must be bought by somebody therefore the value of the total product must be equal to people's total expenditures in buying things the income approach works on the principle that the incomes of the productive factors ("producers" colloquially) must be equal to the value of their product and determines gdp by finding the sum of all producers' incomes[]
production approach
also known as the value added approach it calculates how much value is contributed at each stage of production
this approach mirrors the oecd (organisation for economic co-operation and development) definition given above
estimate the gross value of domestic output out of the many various economic activities;
determine the intermediate consumption ie the cost of material supplies and services used to produce final goods or services
deduct intermediate consumption from gross value to obtain the gross value added
gross value added = gross value of output – value of intermediate consumption
value of output = value of the total sales of goods and services plus the value of changes in the inventory
the sum of the gross value added in the various economic activities is known as "gdp at factor cost"
gdp at factor cost plus indirect taxes fewer subsidies on products = "gdp at producer price"
for measuring the output of domestic product economic activities (ie industries) are classified into various sectors after classifying economic activities the output of each sector is calculated by any of the following two methods:
by multiplying the output of each sector by their respective market price and adding them together
by collecting data on gross sales and inventories from the records of companies and adding them together
the value of output of all sectors is then added to get the gross value of output at factor cost subtracting each sector's intermediate consumption from gross output value gives the gva (=gdp) at factor cost adding indirect tax minus subsidies to gva (gdp) at factor cost gives the "gva (gdp) at producer prices"
income approach
the second way of estimating gdp is to use "the sum of primary incomes distributed by resident producer units"[]
if gdp is calculated this way it is sometimes called gross domestic income (gdi) or gdp (i) gdi should provide the same amount as the expenditure method described later by definition gdi is equal to gdp in practice however measurement errors will make the two figures slightly off when reported by national statistical agencies
this method measures gdp by adding incomes that firms pay households for factors of production they hire - wages for labour interest for capital rent for land and profits for entrepreneurship
the us "national income and product accounts" divide incomes into five categories:
wages salaries and supplementary labor income
corporate profits
interest and miscellaneous investment income
income earned by sole proprietors and from the housing subsector (net of expenses)
net income from transfer payments from businesses
these five income components sum to net domestic income at factor cost
two adjustments must be made to get gdp:
taxes on production and imports minus subsidies are added to get from factor cost to market prices
depreciation (or capital consumption allowance) is added to get from net domestic product to gross domestic product
total income can be subdivided according to various schemes leading to various formulae for gdp measured by the income approach a common one is:[citation needed]
gdp = 
compensation of employees
coe
gross operating surplus
gos
gross mixed income
gmi
taxes less subsidies on production and imports

compensation of employees (coe) measures the total remuneration to employees for work done it includes wages and salaries as well as employer contributions to social security and other such programs
gross operating surplus (gos) is the surplus due to owners of incorporated businesses often called profits although only a subset of total costs are subtracted from gross output to calculate gos
gross mixed income (gmi) is the same measure as gos but for unincorporated businesses this often includes most small businesses
the sum of coe gos and gmi is called total factor income; it is the income of all of the factors of production in society it measures the value of gdp at factor (basic) prices the difference between basic prices and final prices (those used in the expenditure calculation) is the total taxes and subsidies that the government has levied or paid on that production so adding taxes less subsidies on production and imports converts gdp(i) at factor cost to gdp(i) at final prices
total factor income is also sometimes expressed as:
total factor income = employee compensation + corporate profits + proprietor's income + rental income + net interest[]
expenditure approach
the third way to estimate gdp is to calculate the sum of the final uses of goods and services (all uses except intermediate consumption) measured in purchasers' prices[]
market goods that are produced are purchased by someone in the case where a good is produced and unsold the standard accounting convention is that the producer has bought the good from themselves therefore measuring the total expenditure used to buy things is a way of measuring production this is known as the expenditure method of calculating gdp
components of gdp by expenditure
us gdp computed on the expenditure basis
gdp (y) is the sum of consumption (c) investment (i) government expenditures (g) and net exports (x – m)
here is a description of each gdp component:
c (consumption) is normally the largest gdp component in the economy consisting of private expenditures in the economy (household final consumption expenditure) these personal expenditures fall under one of the following categories: durable goods nondurable goods and services examples include food rent jewelry gasoline and medical expenses but not the purchase of new housing
i (investment) includes for instance business investment in equipment but does not include exchanges of existing assets examples include the construction of a new mine the purchase of software or the purchase of machinery and equipment for a factory spending by households (not the government) on new houses is also included in investment in contrast to its colloquial meaning "investment" in gdp does not mean purchases of financial products buying financial products is classed as 'saving' as opposed to investment this avoids double-counting: if one buys shares in a company and the company uses the money received to buy plant equipment etc the amount will be counted toward gdp when the company spends the money on those things; to also count it when one gives it to the company would be to count two times an amount that only corresponds to one group of products buying bonds or companies' equity shares is a swapping of deeds a transfer of claims on future production not directly an expenditure on products; buying an existing building will involve a positive investment by the buyer and a negative investment by the seller netting to zero overall investment
g (government spending) is the sum of government expenditures on final goods and services it includes salaries of public servants purchases of weapons for the military and any investment expenditure by a government it does not include any transfer payments such as social security or unemployment benefits analyses outside the usa will often treat government investment as part of investment rather than government spending
x (exports) represents gross exports gdp captures the amount a country produces including goods and services produced for other nations' consumption therefore exports are added
m (imports) represents gross imports imports are subtracted since imported goods will be included in the terms g i or c and must be deducted to avoid counting foreign supply as domestic
c i and g are expenditures on final goods and services; expenditures on intermediate goods and services do not count (intermediate goods and services are those used by businesses to produce other goods and services within the accounting year[]) so for example if a car manufacturer buys auto parts assembles the car and sells it only the final car sold is counted towards the gdp meanwhile if a person buys replacement auto parts to install them on their car those are counted towards the gdp
according to the us bureau of economic analysis which is responsible for calculating the national accounts in the united states "in general the source data for the expenditures components are considered more reliable than those for the income components [see income method above]"[]
encyclopedia britannica records an alternate way of measuring exports minus imports: notating it as the single variable nx[][]
gdp and gni
gdp can be contrasted with gross national product (gnp) or as it is now known gross national income (gni) the difference is that gdp defines its scope according to location while gni defines its scope according to ownership in a global context world gdp and world gni are therefore equivalent terms
gdp is a product produced within a country's borders; gni is product produced by enterprises owned by a country's citizens the two would be the same if all of the productive enterprises in a country were owned by its own citizens and those citizens did not own productive enterprises in any other countries in practice however foreign ownership makes gdp and gni non-identical production within a country's borders but by an enterprise owned by somebody outside the country counts as part of its gdp but not its gni; on the other hand production by an enterprise located outside the country but owned by one of its citizens counts as part of its gni but not its gdp
for example the gni of the usa is the value of output produced by american-owned firms regardless of where the firms are located similarly if a country becomes increasingly in debt and spends large amounts of income servicing this debt this will be reflected in a decreased gni but not a decreased gdp similarly if a country sells off its resources to entities outside their country this will also be reflected over time in decreased gni but not decreased gdp this would make the use of gdp more attractive for politicians in countries with increasing national debt and decreasing assets
gross national income (gni) equals gdp plus income receipts from the rest of the world minus income payments to the rest of the world[]
in  the united states switched from using gnp to using gdp as its primary measure of production[] the relationship between united states gdp and gnp is shown in table  of the national income and product accounts[]
another example that amplifies the difference between gdp and gni is the comparison of developed and developing country indicators the gdp of japan for  is  usd (in a million)[] predictably as a developed country japan has a higher gni (by  in millions of usd) which is indicative that the production level in the country is higher than that of national production[] on the other hand the case with armenia is the opposite with gdp being lower than gni by  usd (in million) this demonstrates that countries receive investments and foreign aid from abroad[] []
international standards
the international standard for measuring gdp is contained in the book system of national accounts () which was prepared by representatives of the international monetary fund european union organisation for economic co-operation and development united nations and world bank the publication is normally referred to as sna to distinguish it from the previous edition published in  (sna) or  (called sna) []
sna provides a set of rules and procedures for the measurement of national accounts the standards are designed to be flexible to allow for differences in local statistical needs and conditions
national measurement
main article: national agencies responsible for gdp measurement
countries or territories by gdp (ppp) per capita in 
  no data
countries or territories by gdp (nominal) per capita in 
  no data
us  gdp computed on the income basis
within each country gdp is normally measured by a national government statistical agency as private sector organizations normally do not have access to the information required (especially information on expenditure and production by governments)
nominal gdp and adjustments to gdp
the raw gdp figure as given by the equations above is called the nominal historical or current gdp when one compares gdp figures from one year to another it is desirable to compensate for changes in the value of money – for the effects of inflation or deflation to make it more meaningful for year-to-year comparisons it may be multiplied by the ratio between the value of money in the year the gdp was measured and the value of money in a base year
for example suppose a country's gdp in  was  million and its gdp in  was  million suppose also that inflation had halved the value of its currency over that period to meaningfully compare its gdp in  to its gdp in  we could multiply the gdp in  by one-half to make it relative to  as a base year the result would be that the gdp in  equals  million × ⁄ =  million in  monetary terms we would see that the country's gdp had realistically increased  percent over that period not  percent as it might appear from the raw gdp data the gdp adjusted for changes in money value in this way is called the real or constant gdp
the factor used to convert gdp from current to constant values in this way is called the gdp deflator unlike consumer price index which measures inflation or deflation in the price of household consumer goods the gdp deflator measures changes in the prices of all domestically produced goods and services in an economy including investment goods and government services as well as household consumption goods[]
constant-gdp figures allow us to calculate a gdp growth rate which indicates how much a country's production has increased (or decreased if the growth rate is negative) compared to the previous year
real gdp growth rate for year n = 
(real gdp in year n) − (real gdp in year n − )
(real gdp in year n − )
another thing that it may be desirable to account for is population growth if a country's gdp doubled over a certain period but its population tripled the increase in gdp may not mean that the standard of living increased for the country's residents; the average person in the country is producing less than they were before per-capita gdp is a measure to account for population growth
standard of living and gdp: wealth distribution and externalities
gdp per capita is often used as an indicator of living standards[]
the major advantage of gdp per capita as an indicator of the standard of living is that it is measured frequently widely and consistently it is measured frequently in that most countries provide information on gdp every quarter allowing trends to be seen quickly it is measured widely in that some measure of gdp is available for almost every country in the world allowing inter-country comparisons it is measured consistently in that the technical definition of gdp is relatively consistent among countries
gdp does not include several factors that influence the standard of living in particular it fails to account for:
externalities – economic growth may entail an increase in negative externalities that are not directly measured in gdp[][] increased industrial output might grow gdp but any pollution is not counted[]
non-market transactions – gdp excludes activities that are not provided through the market such as household production bartering of goods and services and volunteer or unpaid services
non-monetary economy – gdp omits economies where no money comes into play at all resulting in inaccurate or abnormally low gdp figures for example in countries with major business transactions occurring informally portions of local economy are not easily registered bartering may be more prominent than the use of money even extending to services[]
quality improvements and inclusion of new products – by not fully adjusting for quality improvements and new products gdp understates true economic growth for instance although computers today are less expensive and more powerful than computers from the past gdp treats them as the same products by only accounting for their monetary value the introduction of new products is also difficult to measure accurately and is not reflected in gdp although it may increase the standard of living for example even the richest person in  could not purchase standard products such as antibiotics and cell phones that an average consumer can buy today since such modern conveniences did not exist then
sustainability of growth – gdp is a measurement of economic historic activity and is not necessarily a projection
wealth distribution – gdp does not account for variances in incomes of various demographic groups see income inequality metrics for discussion of a variety of inequality-based economic measures[]
it can be argued that gdp per capita as an indicator of standard of living is correlated with these factors capturing them indirectly[][] as a result gdp per capita as a standard of living is a continued usage because most people have a fairly accurate idea of what it is and know it is tough to come up with quantitative measures for such constructs as happiness quality of life and well-being[]
limitations and criticisms
limitations at introduction
simon kuznets the economist who developed the first comprehensive set of measures of national income stated in his second report to the us congress in  in a section titled "uses and abuses of national income measurements":[]
the valuable capacity of the human mind to simplify a complex situation in a compact characterization becomes dangerous when not controlled in terms of definitely stated criteria with quantitative measurements especially the definiteness of the result suggests often misleadingly a precision and simplicity in the outlines of the object measured measurements of national income are subject to this type of illusion and resulting abuse especially since they deal with matters that are the center of conflict of opposing social groups where the effectiveness of an argument is often contingent upon oversimplification []
all these qualifications upon estimates of national income as an index of productivity are just as important when income measurements are interpreted from the point of view of economic welfare but in the latter case additional difficulties will be suggested to anyone who wants to penetrate below the surface of total figures and market values economic welfare cannot be adequately measured unless the personal distribution of income is known and no income measurement undertakes to estimate the reverse side of income that is the intensity and unpleasantness of effort going into the earning of income the welfare of a nation can therefore scarcely be inferred from a measurement of national income as defined above
in  kuznets stated:[]
distinctions must be kept in mind between quantity and quality of growth between costs and returns and between the short and long run goals for more growth should specify more growth of what and for what
further criticisms
ever since the development of gdp multiple observers have pointed out limitations of using gdp as the overarching measure of economic and social progress for example many environmentalists argue that gdp is a poor measure of social progress because it does not take into account harm to the environment[][] furthermore the gdp does not consider human health nor the educational aspect of a population[] american politician robert f kennedy criticized the gdp as a measure of "everything except that which makes life worthwhile" he said that it "does not allow for the health of our children the quality of their education or the joy of their play"[]
although a high or rising level of gdp is often associated with increased economic and social progress the opposite sometimes occurs for example jean drèze and amartya sen have pointed out that an increase in gdp or in gdp growth does not necessarily lead to a higher standard of living particularly in areas such as healthcare and education[] another important area that does not necessarily improve along with gdp is political liberty which is most notable in china where gdp growth is strong yet political liberties are heavily restricted[] gdp does not account for the distribution of income among the residents of a country because gdp is merely an aggregate measure an economy may be highly developed or growing rapidly but also contain a wide gap between the rich and the poor in a society these inequalities often occur on the lines of race ethnicity gender religion or other minority status within countries[] this can lead to misleading characterizations of economic well-being if the income distribution is heavily skewed toward the high end as the poorer residents will not directly benefit from the overall level of wealth and income generated in their country (their purchasing power can decline even as the mean gdp per capita rises) gdp per capita measures (like aggregate gdp measures) do not account for income distribution (and tend to overstate the average income per capita) for example south africa during apartheid ranked high in terms of gdp per capita but the benefits of this immense wealth and income were not shared equally among its citizens[] an inequality which the united nations sustainable development goal  amongst other global initiatives aims to address[]
gdp excludes the value of household and other unpaid work some including martha nussbaum argue that this value should be included in measuring gdp as household labor is largely a substitute for goods and services that would otherwise be purchased with money[] even under conservative estimates the value of unpaid labor in australia has been calculated to be over  of the country's gdp[] a later study analyzed this value in other countries with results ranging from a low of about  in canada (using conservative estimates) to high of nearly  in the united kingdom (using more liberal estimates) for the united states the value was estimated to be between about  on the low end to nearly  on the high end depending on the methodology being used[] because many public policies are shaped by gdp calculations and by the related field of national accounts[] public policy might differ if unpaid work were included in total gdp some economists have advocated for changes in the way public policies are formed and implemented[]
the uk's natural capital committee highlighted the shortcomings of gdp in its advice to the uk government in  pointing out that gdp "focuses on flows not stocks as a result an economy can run down its assets yet at the same time record high levels of gdp growth until a point is reached where the depleted assets act as a check on future growth" they then went on to say that "it is apparent that the recorded gdp growth rate overstates the sustainable growth rate broader measures of wellbeing and wealth are needed for this and there is a danger that short-term decisions based solely on what is currently measured by national accounts may prove to be costly in the long-term"
it has been suggested that countries that have authoritarian governments such as the people's republic of china and russia inflate their gdp figures[]

instances of gdp measures have been considered numbers that are artificial constructs[] in  scientists as part of a world scientists' warning to humanity-associated series warned that worldwide growth in affluence in terms of gdp-metrics has increased resource use and pollutant emissions with affluent citizens of the world – in terms of eg resource-intensive consumption – being responsible for most negative environmental impacts and central to a transition to safer sustainable conditions they summarised evidence presented solution approaches and stated that far-reaching lifestyle changes need to complement technological advancements and that existing societies economies and cultures incite consumption expansion and that the structural imperative for growth in competitive market economies inhibits societal change[][][] sarah arnold senior economist at the new economics foundation (nef) stated that "gdp includes activities that are detrimental to our economy and society in the long term such as deforestation strip mining overfishing and so on"[] the number of trees that are net lost annually is estimated to be approximately  billion[][] the global average annual deforested land in the – demi-decade was  million hectares and the average annual net forest area loss in the – decade  million hectares according to the global forest resources assessment [] according to one study depending on the level of wealth inequality higher gdp-growth can be associated with more deforestation[] in  "agriculture and agribusiness" accounted for   of the gdp of brazil where a large share of annual net tropical forest loss occurred and is associated with sizable portions of this economic activity domain[] the number of obese adults was approximately  million () in [] in  scientists reported that large improvements in health only lead to modest long-term increases in gdp per capita[] after developing an abstract metric similar to gdp the center for partnership studies highlighted that gdp "and other metrics that reflect and perpetuate them" may not be useful for facilitating the production of products and provision of services that are useful – or comparatively more useful – to society and instead may "actually encourage rather than discourage destructive activities"[][] steve cohen of the earth institute elucidated that while gdp does not distinguish between different activities (or lifestyles) "all consumption behaviors are not created equal and do not have the same impact on environmental sustainability"[] johan rockström director of the potsdam institute for climate impact research noted that "it's difficult to see if the current gdp-based model of economic growth can go hand-in-hand with rapid cutting of emissions" which nations have agreed to attempt under the paris agreement in order to mitigate real-world impacts of climate change[] some have pointed out that gdp did not adapt to sociotechnical changes to give a more accurate picture of the modern economy and does not encapsulate the value of new activities such as delivering price-free information and entertainment on social media[] in  diane coyle explained that gdp excludes much unpaid work writing that "many people contribute free digital work such as writing open-source software that can substitute for marketed equivalents and it clearly has great economic value despite a price of zero" which constitutes a common criticism "of the reliance on gdp as the measure of economic success" especially after the emergence of the digital economy[] similarly gdp does not value or distinguish for environmental protection a  study found that "poor regions' gdp grows faster by attracting more polluting production after connection to china's expressway system[] gdp may not be a tool capable of recognizing how much natural capital agents of the economy are building or protecting[][additional citation(s) needed]
proposals to overcome gdp limitations
in response to these and other limitations of using gdp alternative approaches have emerged
in the s amartya sen and martha nussbaum developed the capability approach which focuses on the functional capabilities enjoyed by people within a country rather than the aggregate wealth held within a country these capabilities consist of the functions that a person is able to achieve[]
in  mahbub ul haq a pakistani economist at the united nations introduced the human development index (hdi) the hdi is a composite index of life expectancy at birth adult literacy rate and standard of living measured as a logarithmic function of gdp adjusted to purchasing power parity
in  john b cobb and herman daly introduced index of sustainable economic welfare (isew) by taking into account various other factors such as consumption of nonrenewable resources and degradation of the environment the new formula deducted from gdp (personal consumption + public non-defensive expenditures - private defensive expenditures + capital formation + services from domestic labour - costs of environmental degradation - depreciation of natural capital)[further explanation needed]
in  med jones an american economist at the international institute of management introduced the first secular gross national happiness index aka gross national well-being framework and index to complement gdp economics with additional seven dimensions including environment education and government work social and health (mental and physical) indicators the proposal was inspired by the king of bhutan's gnh philosophy[][][]
in  the european union released a communication titled gdp and beyond: measuring progress in a changing world[] that identified five actions to improve indicators of progress in ways that make them more responsive to the concerns of its citizens
in  professors joseph stiglitz amartya sen and jean-paul fitoussi at the commission on the measurement of economic performance and social progress (cmepsp) formed by french president nicolas sarkozy published a proposal to overcome the limitation of gdp economics to expand the focus to well-being economics with a well-being framework consisting of health environment work physical safety economic safety and political freedom
in  the centre for bhutan studies began publishing the bhutan gross national happiness (gnh) index whose contributors to happiness include physical mental and spiritual health; time balance; social and community vitality; cultural vitality; education; living standards; good governance; and ecological vitality[]
in  the oecd better life index was published by the oecd the dimensions of the index included health economic workplace income jobs housing civic engagement and life satisfaction
since  john helliwell richard layard and jeffrey sachs have edited an annual world happiness report which reports a national measure of subjective well-being derived from a single survey question on satisfaction with life gdp explains some of the cross-national variation in life satisfaction but more of it is explained by other social variables (see  world happiness report)
in  serge pierre besanger published a "gdp " proposal which combines an expanded gni formula which he calls gnix with a palma ratio and a set of environmental metrics based on the daly rule[]
at the beginning of the st century the world economic forum published a series of analyses and propositions to create economic measurement tools more effective than gdp[]
problems with gdp data
manipulation of data
a peer-reviewed study published in the journal of political economy in october  found signs of manipulation of economic growth statistics in the majority of countries[] according to the study this mainly applied to countries that were governed semi-authoritarian/authoritarian or did not have a functioning separation of powers the study took the annual growth in the brightness of lights at night as measured by satellites and compared it to officially reported economic growth authoritarian states had consistently higher reported growth in gdp than their growth in night lights would suggest an effect that also cannot be explained by different economic structures sector composition or other factors incorrect growth statistics can also falsify indicators such as gdp or gdp per capita[]
the united states of america (usa or usa) commonly known as the united states (us or us) or america is a country primarily located in north america and consisting of  states a federal district five major unincorporated territories nine minor outlying islands[i] and  indian reservations it is the world's third-largest country by both land and total area[c] it shares land borders with canada to its north and with mexico to its south and has maritime borders with the bahamas cuba russia and other nations[j] with a population of over  million[k] it is the most populous country in the americas and the third-most populous in the world the national capital of the united states is washington dc and its most populous city and principal financial center is new york city
indigenous peoples have inhabited the americas for thousands of years beginning in  british colonization led to the establishment of the thirteen colonies in what is now the eastern united states their quarrel with the british crown over taxation and political representation led to the american revolution and the ensuing revolutionary war the united states declared independence on july   becoming the first nation-state founded on enlightenment principles of unalienable natural rights consent of the governed and liberal democracy the country began expanding across north america spanning the continent by  sectional division over slavery led to the secession of the confederate states of america which fought the remaining states of the union during the american civil war (–) with the union's victory and preservation slavery was abolished nationally by  the united states had established itself as a great power becoming the world's largest economy after japan's attack on pearl harbor in  the us entered world war ii on the side of the allies the aftermath of the war left the united states and the soviet union as the world's two superpowers and led to the cold war during the cold war both countries engaged in a struggle for ideological dominance but avoided direct military conflict they also competed in the space race which culminated in the  landing of apollo  making the us the only nation to land humans on the moon with the soviet union's collapse and the subsequent end of the cold war in  the united states emerged as the world's sole superpower
the united states government is a federal republic and a representative democracy with three separate branches of government: executive legislative and judicial it has a bicameral national legislature composed of the house of representatives a lower house based on population; and the senate an upper house based on equal representation for each state many policy issues are decentralized at a state or local level with widely differing laws by jurisdiction the us ranks highly in international measures of quality of life income and wealth economic competitiveness human rights innovation and education; it has low levels of perceived corruption it has higher levels of incarceration and inequality than most other liberal democracies and is the only liberal democracy without universal healthcare as a melting pot of cultures and ethnicities the us has been drastically shaped by the world's largest immigrant population
the united states is a highly developed country that has one of the highest median incomes of any polity in the world its economy accounts for approximately a quarter of global gdp and is the world's largest by gdp at market exchange rates it is the world's largest importer and second-largest exporter and possesses the largest amount of wealth of any country the united states is a founding member of the united nations world bank international monetary fund organization of american states nato world health organization and is a permanent member of the united nations security council it wields considerable global influence as the world's foremost political cultural economic military and scientific power

commissions and their findings

role of magazines in legalization

black feminist scholars have criticised the american adult entertainment industry for what they perceive as omission and exclusion of non-white women[] mainstream porn studios feature black women for lesser number of times than white women in their productions[] mireille miller-young in her research on porn industry had found that black women make less money then their white counterparts white women have historically made  percent more per scene and sometimes still make  percent more compared to the black women[] black feminists have identified the non representation of black women in interracial pornography which happens to be one of the most financially prosperous genres in contemporary american commercial pornography and the creation of another category "reverse ir" as reflective of the larger societal ideals of beauty and body that render women of color as "not merely invisible but also inhuman"[] as pornography becomes a kind of manual on how bodies in pleasure can look and is "one of the few places where we see our bodies--and other people's bodies" it becomes imperative on pornography to represent "variety of forms" stated the black feminist scholars[]

a caricature on "the great epidemic of pornography" french illustration (c  – c  ce)
prominent anti-pornography feminists such as andrea dworkin and catharine mackinnon argue that all pornography is demeaning to women or that it contributes to violence against women–both in its production and in its consumption the production of pornography they argue entails the physical psychological or economic coercion of the women who perform in it they charged that pornography eroticizes the domination humiliation and coercion of women and reinforces sexual and cultural attitudes that are complicit in rape and sexual harassment[][][] other sex work exclusionary feminists have insisted that pornography presents a severely distorted image of sexual consent and that it reinforces sexual myths like: women are readily available–and desire to engage in sex at any time–with any man–on men's terms–and always respond positively to men's advances[]

in contrast to the objections other feminist scholars "ranging from betty friedan and kate millett to karen decrow wendy kaminer and jamaica kincaid" have supported the right to consume pornography[] the anti-porn feminist stranglehold began to loose when sex-positive feminists like susie bright performers nina hartley and candida royalle affirmed the rights of women to consume and produce porn[] the works of camille paglia established that westerners have been "pagan celebrants" for long and pornography has been an inseparable part of western culture[] wendy mcelroy has noted that both feminism and pornography are mutually related with both thriving in environments of tolerance and both repressed anytime regulations are placed on sexual expression[] societies where pornography and sexual expression is prohibited are more likely to be the places where women are often subjected to violence and sexual abuse[]
women's rights are far stronger in societies with liberal attitudes to sex – think of conservative countries such as afghanistan yemen or china and the place of women there and yet anti-porn campaigners neglect such issues entirely a recent study by the us department of justice compared the four states that had highest broadband access and found there was a  per cent decrease in rape and attempted rape and the four with the lowest had a  per cent increase over the same period

rise of feminist porn
the lesbian feminist movement of the s is considered a seminal moment for the women in the porn industry as more women entered into the developmental side of the industry[] this allowed women to gear porn more towards women as they knew what women wanted both from the perspective of actresses as well as the female audience this change has been considered a good development as for a long time the porn industry has been directed by men for men this move also sparked the arrival of making lesbian porn for lesbians instead of men[]
furthermore the advent of vcr home video and affordable consumer video cameras allowed for the possibility of feminist pornography[] consumer video made it possible for the distribution and consumption of video pornography; and to locate women as legitimate consumers of pornography[] feminist porn directors are interested in challenging representations of men and women as well as providing sexually-empowering imagery that features many kinds of bodies[] tristan taormino says that feminist porn is "all about creating a fair working environment and empowering everyone involved"[] porn for women is identified by factors like greater attention to "sensual surroundings" and "soft focus camerawork" rather than on the explicit depiction of sexual activity making the productions more warm and humane compared to the traditional porn made for hetrosexual men[] women are more likely to consume pornography that is "female-centered" and feature acts such as cunnilingus most often made by women in these works the initiation of sexual activity is done by the female[]

porn industry has been noted for being one of the few industries where women enjoy a power advantage in the workplace "actresses have the power" alec metro one of the men in line ruefully noticed of the x-rated industry a former firefighter who claimed to have lost a bid for a job to affirmative action metro was already divining that porn might not be the ideal career choice for escaping the forces of what he called 'reverse discrimination'[] female performers can often dictate which male actors they will and will not work with porn—at least porn produced for a heterosexual audience—is one of the few contemporary occupations where the pay gap operates in the favour of women the average actress makes fifty to a hundred per cent more money than her male counterpart[][]
psychological perspective
in analytical psychology the human psyche is believed to be composed of psychological principles that are feminine as well as masculine in nature[] according to psychologist and author giorgio tricarico as an individual moves through various life experiences the psyche approaches a polarity of non-differentiation[] the ability to move towards this state of non-differentiation is assumed to be higher in females than males[] the feminine embodies particular qualities of the sacred or divine more broadly and deeply than the masculine[] the unconscious perception by males of this power in females is reasoned to be a cause for the intentional humiliation wilful devaluation and deliberate belittlement of women by men[]
tricarico professed that modern-day pornography is a "desacralised technological and consumerist" equivalent of the ancient sacred prostitution – a custom that involved honouring of the sacred feminine and worship of the sacred prostitutes as the goddess herself[] he argued that women in porn through their performance of various difficult actions as if they are delighting in them would inadvertently approach the state of non-differentiation an effect which he called as "intimation of hierophany"[] "porn actresses may embody the medium to enter what used to be the realm of the sacred" he said[] the porn actresses have been likened to the "descendants of the lost goddesses" who are now offering the gift of the "numinous" to all through their performances but are being unacknowledged or devalued by all for their contributions[]
the use of epithets like "bitch" "whore" "slut" for sexually active women is attributed to denial of the subjective feminine by men[] the subdued acceptance of female sexuality as a value in its own right is manifested when a man's admiration for a "bitch" gets subtended if she happens to be his wife or girlfriend[] along with showing "admiration lust gratitude and desire" men can show brazen hate and disgust towards women this behavioural dichotomy had been ascribed to the "patriarchal hypocrisy" embedded in men[] tricarico hoped that porn becomes a place where the male performers can discard patriarchal antics the female performers would embrace facets of the sacred while continuing to present the world with glimpses of her grace and the audience incorporate porn into their lives as a joyful experience – a genuine form of play that helps them approach non-differentiation[]

as most religions have long and vehemently opposed sexual natured things in general religious people are found highly susceptible to experience great distress in their use of pornography religious people who use pornography tend to feel sexually ashamed[] sexual shame—which arises from a person's perception of their self in other peoples mind and a negative assessment of their own sexuality—is considered a powerful factor that over time governs individual behaviour[][] as sexuality is interwoven into one's personal identity sexual shame or sexual embarrassment are found to attack a person's very sense of self[]
when a sexual shaming event occurs the person attributes causation to oneself resulting in self condemnation and experience feelings of sadness loneliness anger unworthiness and rejection along with a perceived judgment of their self by others[] in this mental landscape a fear arises that ones sexual self needs to be hiden this psychological process initiates and fuels further shame and lowers one's self-esteem[] sexual shame constricts the "psychic space for free play with one's sexuality"[] sexual shame in people begets more shame and leads to a cycle of powerlessness culminating in deepening negative emotions[] those who tend to feel shame easily are found to be at greater risk for depression and anxiety disorders[]
the cause of attributing shame to sexuality is traced back to the biblical interpretation of nakedness being shameful[i] much of the christian mythology presented sexuality as an obstacle to be surmounted in the way of salvation the major abrahamic religions condemn and consider all forms of nonmarital and nonreproductive sexual pleasure as unacceptable in hinduism bhoga (sexual pleasure) is celebrated as a value in itself and is considered one of the two ways to nirvana the other being the more demanding yoga[j] one of the central concepts in hinduism is that of purushartha which is defined as the objective or purpose of human existence it essentially advocates pursuit of the four main proper goals for a happy life they being: dharma (virtue performance of one's duty) artha (acquiring wealth prosperity) kama (desires sensory pleasures) and moksha (spiritual knowledge liberation)[] the pursuit of kama was elaborated by the sage vatsyayana in his treatise kama sutra which states that sexual pleasure just like food is essential for the well being of the body and that on both of them are founded virtue and prosperity[] food despite causing indigestion sometimes would still be consumed regularly and so it must be with pleasure which must be pursued with caution while eliminating any unwanted or harmful effects just as no one abstains from cooking food worrying about beggars who ask for it or restrain from sowing wheat fearing animals that may destroy the crop similarly claims vatsyayana one must pursue kama even though dangers exist; and those who are accomplished in dharma artha and kama would attain happiness in this world and hereafter[]
